When building from a tarball without Sphinx (that is, with \fB\-DBUILD_DOCS=OFF\fP or when \fBsphinx\-build\fP is not found),
builtin man pages and help files were missing, which has been fixed (#12052 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:12052>).

fish now assumes UTF\-8 for character encoding even if the system does not have a UTF\-8 locale.
Input bytes which are not valid UTF\-8 are still round\-tripped correctly.
For example, file paths using legacy encodings can still be used,
but may be rendered differently on the command line.

The title of the terminal tab can now be set separately from the window title by defining the fish_tab_title \%<> function (#2692 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:2692>).
.IP \(bu 2
fish now hides the portion of a multiline prompt that is scrolled out of view due to a huge command line. This prevents duplicate lines after repainting with partially visible prompt (#11911 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:11911>).

fish_config prompt \%<>\(aqs \fBchoose\fP and \fBsave\fP subcommands have been taught to reset fish_mode_prompt \%<> in addition to the other prompt functions (#11937 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:11937>).
.IP \(bu 2
fish no longer force\-disables mouse capture (DECSET/DECRST 1000),
so you can use those commands
to let mouse clicks move the cursor or select completions items (#4918 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:4918>).

Documentation in release tarballs is now built with the latest version of Sphinx,
which means that pre\-built man pages include OSC 8 hyperlinks \%<#\:term-compat-osc-8>\&.
.IP \(bu 2
The Sphinx dependency is now specified in \fBpyproject.toml\fP,
which allows you to use uv \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:astral-sh/uv> to provide Sphinx for building documentation (e.g. \fBuv run cargo install \-\-path .\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) has been updated to 1.85.
.IP \(bu 2
The standalone build mode has been made the default.
This means that the files in \fB$CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/share/fish\fP will not be used anymore, except for HTML docs.
As a result, future upgrades will no longer break running shells
if one of fish\(aqs internal helper functions has been changed in the updated version.
For now, the data files are still installed redundantly,
to prevent upgrades from breaking already\-running shells (#11921 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:11921>).
To reverse this change (which should not be necessary),
patch out the \fBembed\-data\fP feature from \fBcmake/Rust.cmake\fP\&.
This option will be removed in future.

Note that you can work around this type of issue by configuring fish\(aqs message localization \%<>:
if your environment contains something like \fBLANG=zh_CN.UTF\-8\fP,

fish now supports transient prompts: if \fBfish_transient_prompt\fP \%<#\:envvar-fish_transient_prompt> is set to 1, fish will reexecute prompt functions with the \fB\-\-final\-rendering\fP argument before running a commandline (#11153 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:11153>).
.IP \(bu 2
Tab completion results are truncated up to the common directory path, instead of somewhere inside that path. E.g. if you complete \(dqshare/functions\(dq, and it includes the files \(dqfoo.fish\(dq and \(dqbar.fish\(dq,
the completion pager will now show \(dq…/foo.fish\(dq and \(dq…/bar.fish\(dq (#11250 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:11250>).

.SS Changes to self\-installing builds
.sp
The self\-installing build type introduced in fish 4.0 has been changed (#11143 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:11143>).
Now fish built with embedded data will just read the data straight from its own binary or write it out to temporary files when necessary, instead of requiring an installation step on start.
That means it is now possible to build fish as a single file and copy it to any system with a compatible CPU architecture, including as a different user, without extracting any files.
As before, this is the default when building via \fBcargo\fP, and disabled when building via CMake.
For packagers we continue to recommend CMake.
.sp
Note: When fish is built like this, the \fB__fish_data_dir\fP variable will be empty because that directory no longer has meaning.
You should generally not need these files.
For example, if you want to make sure that completions for \(dqfoo\(dq are loaded, use \fBcomplete \-C\(dqfoo \(dq >/dev/null\fP  instead).
The raw files are still exposed via status subcommands \%<#\:status-get-file>, mainly for fish\(aqs internal use, but you can also use them as a last resort.
.sp

.SS Changes to gettext localization
.sp
We replaced several parts of the gettext functionality with custom implementations (#11726 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:11726>).
Most notably, message extraction, which should now work reliably, and the runtime implementation, where we no longer dynamically link to gettext, but instead use our own implementation, whose behavior is similar to GNU gettext, with some minor deviations \%<>\&.
Our implementation now fully respects fish variables, so locale variables do not have to be exported for fish localizations to work.
They still have to be exported to inform other programs about language preferences.
The \fBLANGUAGE\fP \%<#\:envvar-LANGUAGE> environment variable is now treated as a path variable, meaning it is an implicitly colon\-separated list.
While we no longer have any runtime dependency on gettext, we still need gettext tools for building, most notably \fBmsgfmt\fP\&.
When building without \fBmsgfmt\fP available, localization will not work with the resulting executable.
Localization data is no longer sourced at runtime from MO files on the file system, but instead built into the executable.
This is always done, independently of the other data embedding, so all fish executables will have access to all message catalogs, regardless of the state of the file system.
Disabling our new \fBlocalize\-messages\fP cargo feature will cause fish to be built without localization support.
CMake builds can continue to use the \fBWITH_GETTEXT\fP option, with the same semantics as the \fBlocalize\-messages\fP feature.
The current implementation does not provide any configuration options for controlling which language catalogs are built into the executable (other than disabling them all).
As a workaround, you can delete files in the \fBpo\fP directory before building to exclude unwanted languages.
.SS Changes to the argparse \%<> builtin
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBargparse\fP now saves recognised options, including option\-arguments in \fBargv_opts\fP \%<#\:envvar-argv_opts>, allowing them to be forwarded to other commands (#6466 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:6466>).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBargparse\fP options can now be marked to be deleted from \fBargv_opts\fP \%<#\:envvar-argv_opts> (by adding a \fB&\fP at the end of the option spec, before a \fB!\fP if present). There is now also a corresponding \fB\-d\fP / \fB\-\-delete\fP option to \fBfish_opt\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBargparse \-\-ignore\-unknown\fP now removes preceding known short options from groups containing unknown options (e.g. when parsing \fB\-abc\fP, if \fBa\fP is known but \fBb\fP is not, then \fBargv\fP \%<#\:envvar-argv> will contain \fB\-bc\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBargparse\fP now has an \fB\-u\fP / \fB\-\-move\-unknown\fP option that works like \fB\-\-ignore\-unknown\fP but preserves unknown options in \fBargv\fP \%<#\:envvar-argv>\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBargparse\fP now has an \fB\-S\fP / \fB\-\-strict\-longopts\fP option that forbids abbreviating long options or passing them with a single dash (e.g. if there is a long option called \fBfoo\fP, \fB\-\-fo\fP and \fB\-\-foo\fP won\(aqt match it).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBargparse\fP now has a \fB\-U\fP / \fB\-\-unknown\-arguments\fP option to specify how to parse unknown option\(aqs arguments.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBargparse\fP now allows specifying options that take multiple optional values by using \fB=*\fP in the option spec (#8432 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:8432>).
In addition, \fBfish_opt\fP has been modified to support such options by using the \fB\-\-multiple\-vals\fP together with \fB\-o\fP / \fB\-\-optional\-val\fP; \fB\-m\fP is also now acceptable as an abbreviation for \fB\-\-multiple\-vals\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_opt\fP no longer requires you give a short flag name when defining options, provided you give it a long flag name with more than one character.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBargparse\fP option specifiers for long\-only options can now start with \fB/\fP, allowing the definition of long options with a single letter. Due to this change, the \fB\-\-long\-only\fP option to \fBfish_opt\fP is now no longer necessary and is deprecated.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_opt\fP now has a \fB\-v\fP / \fB\-\-validate\fP option you can use to give a fish script to validate values of the option.

For many years, fish has been \(dqrelocatable\(dq \-\- it was possible to move the entire \fBCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX\fP and fish would use paths relative to its binary.
Only gettext locale paths were still determined purely at compile time, which has been fixed.

.IP \(bu 2
To work around terminals that fail to parse Operating System Command (OSC) sequences, a temporary feature flag has been added.

.SH FISH 4.0.0 (RELEASED FEBRUARY 27, 2025)
.sp
fish\(aqs core code has been ported from C++ to Rust (#9512 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:9512>). This means a large change in dependencies and how to build fish. However, there should be no direct impact on users. Packagers should see the For Distributors section at the end.
.SS Notable backwards\-incompatible changes
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
As part of a larger binding rework, \fBbind\fP gained a new key notation.
In most cases the old notation should keep working, but in rare cases you may have to change a \fBbind\fP invocation to use the new notation.
See below for details.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBctrl\fP\-\fBc\fP now calls a new bind function called \fBclear\-commandline\fP\&. The old behavior, which leaves a \(dq^C\(dq marker, is available as \fBcancel\-commandline\fP (#10935 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:10935>)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBrandom\fP will produce different values from previous versions of fish when used with the same seed, and will work more sensibly with small seed numbers.
The seed was never guaranteed to give the same result across systems,
so we do not expect this to have a large impact (#9593 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:9593>).
.IP \(bu 2
Variables in command position that expand to a subcommand keyword are now forbidden to fix a likely user error.
For example, \fBset editor command emacs; $editor\fP is no longer allowed (#10249 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:10249>).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfunctions \-\-handlers\fP will now list handlers in a different order.
Now it is definition order, first to last, where before it was last to first.
This was never specifically defined, and we recommend not relying on a specific order (#9944 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:9944>).
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBqmark\-noglob\fP feature, introduced in fish 3.0, is enabled by default. That means \fB?\fP will no longer act as a single\-character glob.
You can, for the time being, turn it back on by adding \fBno\-qmark\-noglob\fP to \fBfish_features\fP and restarting fish:

The flag will eventually be made read\-only, making it impossible to turn off.
.IP \(bu 2
Terminals that fail to ignore unrecognized OSC or CSI sequences may display garbage. We know cool\-retro\-term and emacs\(aq ansi\-term are affected, but most mainstream terminals are not.
.IP \(bu 2
fish no longer searches directories from the Windows system/user \fB$PATH\fP environment variable for Linux executables. To execute Linux binaries by name (i.e. not with a relative or absolute path) from a Windows folder, make sure the \fB/mnt/c/...\fP path is explicitly added to \fB$fish_user_paths\fP and not just automatically appended to \fB$PATH\fP by \fBwsl.exe\fP (#10506 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:10506>).
.IP \(bu 2
Under Microsoft Windows Subsystem for Linux 1 (not WSL 2), backgrounded jobs that have not been disowned and do not terminate on their own after a \fBSIGHUP\fP + \fBSIGCONT\fP sequence will be explicitly killed by fish on exit (after the usual prompt to close or disown them) to work around a WSL 1 deficiency that sees backgrounded processes that run into \fBSIGTTOU\fP remain in a suspended state indefinitely (#5263 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:5263>). The workaround is to explicitly \fBdisown\fP processes you wish to outlive the shell session.

Depending on terminal support, this allows to binding more key combinations, including arbitrary combinations of modifiers \fBctrl\fP, \fBalt\fP and \fBshift\fP, and distinguishing (for example) \fBctrl\fP\-\fBi\fP from \fBtab\fP\&.
.sp
Additionally, \fBbind\fP now supports a human\-readable syntax in addition to byte sequences.
This includes modifier names, and names for keys like \fBenter\fP and \fBbackspace\fP\&.
For example
.INDENT 2.0

.sp
Any key argument that starts with an ASCII control character (like \fB\ee\fP or \fB\ecX\fP) or is up to 3 characters long, not a named key, and does not contain \fB,\fP or \fB\-\fP will be interpreted in the old syntax to keep compatibility for the majority of bindings.

fish can now be built as a self\-installing binary (#10367 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:10367>). That means it can be easily built on one system and copied to another, where it can extract supporting files.
To do this, run:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
cargo install \-\-path . # in a clone of the fish repository

The first time it runs interactively, it will extract all the data files to  \fB~/.local/share/fish/install/\fP\&. A specific path can be used for the data files with \fBfish \-\-install=PATH\fP To uninstall, remove the fish binaries and that directory.
.sp
This build system is experimental; the main build system, using \fBcmake\fP, remains the recommended approach for packaging and installation to a prefix.

\fBcommandline \-\-tokenize\fP (short option \fB\-o\fP) has been deprecated in favor of \fBcommandline \-\-tokens\-expanded\fP (short option \fB\-x\fP) which expands variables and other shell syntax, removing the need to use eval \%<> in completion scripts (#10212 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:10212>).

Two new feature flags:

\fBremove\-percent\-self\fP (see \fBstatus features\fP) disables PID expansion of \fB%self\fP, which has been supplanted by \fB$fish_pid\fP (#10262 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:10262>).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtest\-require\-arg\fP disables \fBtest\fP\(aqs one\-argument mode. That means \fBtest \-n\fP without an additional argument will return false, \fBtest \-z\fP will keep returning true. Any other option without an argument, anything that is not an option and no argument will be an error. This also goes for \fB[\fP, test\(aqs alternate name.
This is a frequent source of confusion and so we are breaking with POSIX explicitly in this regard.
In addition to the feature flag, there is a debug category \(dqdeprecated\-test\(dq. Running fish with \fBfish \-d deprecated\-test\fP will show warnings whenever a \fBtest\fP invocation that would change is used. (#10365 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:10365>).

When a terminal pastes text into fish using bracketed paste, fish used to switch to a special \fBpaste\fP bind mode.
This bind mode has been removed. The behavior on paste is no longer configurable.
.IP \(bu 2
When an interactive fish is stopped or terminated by a signal that cannot be caught (SIGSTOP or SIGKILL), it may leave the terminal in a state where keypresses with modifiers are sent as CSI u sequences, instead of traditional control characters or escape sequences that are recognized by Readline and compatible programs, such as bash and python.

Normally, file name completions start after the last \fB:\fP  or \fB=\fP in a token.

This special meaning can now disabled by escaping these separators as \fB\e:\fP and \fB\e=\fP\&.

fish has been ported to Rust. This means a significant change in dependencies, which are listed in the README. In short, Rust 1.70 or greater is required, and a C++ compiler is no longer needed (although a C compiler is still required, for some C glue code and the tests).

.SH FISH 3.7.0 (RELEASED JANUARY 1, 2024)

This release of fish includes a number of improvements over fish 3.6.4, detailed below. Although work continues on the porting of fish internals to the Rust programming language, that work is not included in this release. fish 3.7.0 and any future releases in the 3.7 series remain C++ programs.
.SS Notable improvements and fixes
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Improvements to the history pager, including:
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
The history pager will now also attempt subsequence matches (#9476 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:9476>), so you can find a command line like \fBgit log 3.6.1..Integration_3.7.0\fP by searching for \fBgitInt\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
Opening the history pager will now fill the search field with a search string if you\(aqre already in a search (#10005 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:10005>). This makes it nicer to search something with \fBup\fP and then later decide to switch to the full pager.
.IP \(bu 2
Closing the history pager with enter will now copy the search text to the commandline if there was no match, so you can continue editing the command you tried to find right away (#9934 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:9934>).
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
Performance improvements for command completions and globbing, where supported by the operating system, especially on slow filesystems such as NFS (#9891 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:9891>, #9931 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:9931>, #10032 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:10032>, #10052 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:10052>).
.IP \(bu 2
fish can now be configured to wait a specified amount of time for a multi\-key sequence to be completed,  instead of waiting indefinitely. For example, this makes binding \fBkj\fP to switching modes in vi mode possible.
The timeout can be set via the new \fBfish_sequence_key_delay_ms\fP \%<#\:envvar-fish_sequence_key_delay_ms> variable (#7401 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:7401>), and may be set by default in future versions.

\fBcommand time\fP in a pipeline is allowed again, as is \fBcommand and\fP and \fBcommand or\fP (#9985 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:9985>).

.SH FISH 3.6.2 (RELEASED DECEMBER 4, 2023)
.sp
This release of fish contains a security fix for CVE\-2023\-49284, a minor security problem identified
in fish 3.6.1 and previous versions (thought to affect all released versions of fish).
.sp
fish uses certain Unicode non\-characters internally for marking wildcards and expansions. It
incorrectly allowed these markers to be read on command substitution output, rather than
transforming them into a safe internal representation.
.sp
For example, \fBecho \eUFDD2HOME\fP has the same output as \fBecho $HOME\fP\&.
.sp
While this may cause unexpected behavior with direct input, this may become a minor security problem
if the output is being fed from an external program into a command substitution where this output
may not be expected.

.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBstderr\-nocaret\fP feature flag, introduced in fish 3.0 and enabled by default in fish 3.1, has been made read\-only.
That means it is no longer possible to disable it, and code supporting the \fB^\fP redirection has been removed (#8857 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:8857>, #8865 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:8865>).
.sp
To recap: fish used to support \fB^\fP to redirect stderr, so you could use commands like:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
test \(dq$foo\(dq \-gt 8 ^/dev/null
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
to ignore error messages. This made the \fB^\fP symbol require escaping and quoting, and was a bit of a weird shortcut considering \fB2>\fP already worked, which is only one character longer.
.sp
So the above can simply become:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
test \(dq$foo\(dq \-gt 8 2>/dev/null
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
The following feature flags have been enabled by default:
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBregex\-easyesc\fP, which makes \fBstring replace \-r\fP not do a superfluous round of unescaping in the replacement expression.
That means e.g. to escape any \(dqa\(dq or \(dqb\(dq in an argument you can use \fBstring replace \-ra \(aq([ab])\(aq \(aq\e\e\e\e$1\(aq foobar\fP instead of needing 8 backslashes.
.sp
This only affects the \fIreplacement\fP expression, not the \fImatch\fP expression (the \fB\(aq([ab])\(aq\fP part in the example).
A survey of plugins on GitHub did not turn up any affected code, so we do not expect this to affect many users.
.sp
This flag was introduced in fish 3.1.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBampersand\-nobg\-in\-token\fP, which means that \fB&\fP will not create a background job if it occurs in the middle of a word. For example, \fBecho foo&bar\fP will print \(dqfoo&bar\(dq instead of running \fBecho foo\fP in the background and then starting \fBbar\fP as a second job.
.sp
Reformatting with \fBfish_indent\fP would already introduce spaces, turning \fBecho foo&bar\fP into \fBecho foo & bar\fP\&.
.sp
This flag was introduced in fish 3.4.
.UNINDENT
.sp
To turn off these flags, add \fBno\-regex\-easyesc\fP or \fBno\-ampersand\-nobg\-in\-token\fP to \fBfish_features\fP and restart fish:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

.IP \(bu 2
Fish\(aqs escape sequence removal (like for \fBstring length \-\-visible\fP or to figure out how wide the prompt is) no longer has special support for non\-standard color sequences like from Data General terminals, e.g. the Data General Dasher D220 from 1984. This removes a bunch of work in the common case, allowing \fBstring length \-\-visible\fP to be much faster with unknown escape sequences. We don\(aqt expect anyone to have ever used fish with such a terminal (#8769 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:8769>).
.IP \(bu 2

.IP \(bu 2
The meaning of an empty color variable has changed (#8793 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:8793>). Previously, when a variable was set but empty, it would be interpreted as the \(dqnormal\(dq color. Now, empty color variables cause the same effect as unset variables \- the general highlighting variable for that type is used instead. For example:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set \-g fish_color_command blue
set \-g fish_color_keyword
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
would previously make keywords \(dqnormal\(dq (usually white in a dark terminal). Now it\(aqll make them blue. To achieve the previous behavior, use the normal color explicitly: \fBset \-g fish_color_keyword normal\fP\&.
.sp
This makes it easier to make self\-contained color schemes that don\(aqt accidentally use color that was set before.
\fBfish_config\fP has been adjusted to set known color variables that a theme doesn\(aqt explicitly set to empty.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBeval\fP is now a reserved keyword, so it can\(aqt be used as a function name. This follows \fBset\fP and \fBread\fP, and is necessary because it can\(aqt be cleanly shadowed by a function \- at the very least \fBeval set \-l argv foo\fP breaks. Fish will ignore autoload files for it, so left over \fBeval.fish\fP from previous fish versions won\(aqt be loaded.
.IP \(bu 2
The git prompt in informative mode now defaults to skipping counting untracked files, as this was extremely slow. To turn it on, set \fB__fish_git_prompt_showuntrackedfiles\fP or set the git config value \(dqbash.showuntrackedfiles\(dq to \fBtrue\fP explicitly (which can be done for individual repositories). The \(dqinformative+vcs\(dq sample prompt already skipped display of untracked files, but didn\(aqt do so in a way that skipped the computation, so it should be quite a bit faster in many cases (#8980 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:8980>).
.IP \(bu 2
The \fB__terlar_git_prompt\fP function, used by the \(dqTerlar\(dq sample prompt, has been rebuilt as a configuration of the normal \fBfish_git_prompt\fP to ease maintenance, improve performance and add features (like reading per\-repo git configuration). Some slight changes remain; users who absolutely must have the same behavior are encouraged to copy the old function (#9011 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:9011>, #7918 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:7918>, #8979 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:8979>).

Complementing the \fBprompt\fP command in 3.3.0, \fBfish_config\fP gained a \fBtheme\fP subcommand to show and pick from the sample themes (meaning color schemes) directly in the terminal, instead of having to open a Web browser. For example \fBfish_config theme choose Nord\fP loads the Nord theme in the current session (#8132 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:8132>). The current theme can be saved with \fBfish_config theme dump\fP, and custom themes can be added by saving them in \fB~/.config/fish/themes/\fP\&.

The \fBfish_git_prompt\fP function, which is included in the default prompts, now overrides \fBgit\fP to avoid running  commands set by per\-repository configuration.

A new feature flag, \fBampersand\-nobg\-in\-token\fP makes \fB&\fP only act as background operator if followed by a separator. In combination with \fBqmark\-noglob\fP, this allows entering most URLs at the command line without quoting or escaping (#7991 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:7991>). For example:

\fBset \-\-query\fP now returns an exit status of 255 if given no variable names. This means \fBif set \-q $foo\fP will not enter the if\-block if \fB$foo\fP is empty or unset.

\fBcomplete\fP takes the first argument as the name of the command if the \fB\-\-command\fP/\fB\-c\fP option is not used,
so \fBcomplete git\fP is treated like \fBcomplete \-\-command git\fP,

A new variable \fB$status_generation\fP is incremented only when the previous command produces an exit status (#6815 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:6815>). This can be used, for example, to check whether a failure status is a holdover due to a background job, or actually produced by the last run command.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_greeting\fP is now a function that reads a variable of the same name, and defaults to setting it globally.
This removes a universal variable by default and helps with updating the greeting.
However, to disable the greeting it is now necessary to explicitly specify universal scope (\fBset \-U fish_greeting\fP) or to disable it in config.fish (#7265 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:7265>).

The command\-not\-found handling has been simplified.
When it can\(aqt find a command, fish now just executes a function called \fBfish_command_not_found\fP

\fBstring replace\fP has an additional round of escaping in the
replacement expression, so escaping backslashes requires many escapes
(eg \fBstring replace \-ra \(aq([ab])\(aq \(aq\e\e\e\e\e\e\e$1\(aq a\fP). The new feature
flag \fBregex\-easyesc\fP can be used to disable this, so that the same

The paths for completions, functions and configuration snippets have
been extended. On systems that define \fBXDG_DATA_DIRS\fP, each of the

\fBfish/vendor_completions.d\fP, \fBfish/vendor_functions.d\fP, and

C++, specifically C++11 (from 2011). This affects some older platforms:
.SS Linux

For users building from source, GCC’s g++ 4.8 or later, or LLVM’s clang
3.3 or later, are known to work. Older platforms may require a newer
compiler installed.

X 10.6 (“SnowLeopard”). If this library is not installed, you will see
this error: \fBdyld: Library not loaded: /usr/lib/libc++.1.dylib\fP

MacPorts is the easiest way to obtain this library. After installing the

.SH FISH 2.1.2 (RELEASED FEB 24, 2015)
.sp
fish 2.1.2 contains a workaround for a filesystem bug in Mac OS X
Yosemite. #1859 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:1859>
.sp
Specifically, after installing fish 2.1.1 and then rebooting, “Verify
Disk” in Disk Utility will report “Invalid number of hard links.” We
don’t have any reports of data loss or other adverse consequences. fish
2.1.2 avoids triggering the bug, but does not repair an already affected
filesystem. To repair the filesystem, you can boot into Recovery Mode
and use Repair Disk from Disk Utility. Linux and versions of OS X prior
to Yosemite are believed to be unaffected.
.sp
There are no other changes in this release.

\fBImportant:\fP if you are upgrading, stop all running instances of
\fBfishd\fP as soon as possible after installing this release; it will be
restarted automatically. On most systems, there will be no further
action required. Note that some environments (where \fBXDG_RUNTIME_DIR\fP
is set), such as Fedora 20, will require a restart of all running fish
processes before universal variables work as intended.

Distributors are highly encouraged to call \fBkillall fishd\fP,
\fBpkill fishd\fP or similar in installation scripts, or to warn their
users to do so.

\fBTab completions will fuzzy\-match files.\fP #568 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:568>
.sp
When tab\-completing a file, fish will first attempt prefix matches
(\fBfoo\fP matches \fBfoobar\fP), then substring matches (\fBooba\fP
matches \fBfoobar\fP), and lastly subsequence matches (\fBfbr\fP matches
\fBfoobar\fP). For example, in a directory with files foo1.txt,
foo2.txt, foo3.txt…, you can type only the numeric part and hit tab
to fill in the rest.
.sp
This feature is implemented for files and executables. It is not yet
implemented for options (like \fB\-\-foobar\fP), and not yet implemented
across path components (like \fB/u/l/b\fP to match \fB/usr/local/bin\fP).

backgrounded jobs, or all jobs owned by your user. Now it expands to
the last job backgrounded. If no job is in the background, it will
fail to expand. In particular, \fBfg %\fP can be used to put the most

in a muted gray when possible. You can accept the suggestion with the
right arrow key or Ctrl\-F. Suggestions come from command history,
completions, and some custom code for cd; there’s a lot of potential
for improvement here. The suggestions are computed on a background
pthread, so they never slow down your typing. The autosuggestion
feature is incredible. I miss it dearly every time I use anything
else.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBterm256 support\fP where available, specifically modern xterms and
OS X Lion. You can specify colors the old way (‘set_color cyan’) or
by specifying RGB hex values (‘set_color FF3333’); fish will pick the
closest supported color. Some xterms do not advertise term256 support
either in the $TERM or terminfo max_colors field, but nevertheless
support it. For that reason, fish will default into using it on any
xterm (but it can be disabled with an environment variable).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBWeb\-based configuration\fP page. There is a new function
‘fish_config’. This spins up a simple Python web server and opens a
browser window to it. From this web page, you can set your shell
colors and view your functions, variables, and history; all changes
apply immediately to all running shells. Eventually all configuration
ought to be supported via this mechanism (but in addition to, not
instead of, command line mechanisms).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBMan page completions\fP\&. There is a new function
‘fish_update_completions’. This function reads all the man1 files
from your manpath, removes the roff formatting, parses them to find
the commands and options, and outputs fish completions into
~/.config/fish/completions. It won’t overwrite existing completion
files (except ones that it generated itself).

fish is now entirely in C++. I have no particular love for C++, but
it provides a ready memory\-model to replace halloc. We’ve made an
effort to keep it to a sane and portable subset (no C++11, no boost,
no going crazy with templates or smart pointers), but we do use the
STL and a little tr1.
.IP \(bu 2
halloc is entirely gone, replaced by normal C++ ownership semantics.
If you don’t know what halloc is, well, now you have two reasons to
be happy.
.IP \(bu 2
All the crufty C data structures are entirely gone. array_list_t,
priority_queue_t, hash_table_t, string_buffer_t have been removed and
replaced by STL equivalents like std::vector, std::map, and
std::wstring. A lot of the string handling now uses std::wstring
instead of wchar_t *
.IP \(bu 2
fish now spawns pthreads for tasks like syntax highlighting that
require blocking I/O.
.IP \(bu 2
History has been completely rewritten. History files now use an
extensible YAML\-style syntax. History “merging” (multiple shells
writing to the same history file) now works better. There is now a
maximum history length of about 250k items (256 * 1024).
.IP \(bu 2
The parser has been “instanced,” so you can now create more than one.
.IP \(bu 2
Total #LoC has shrunk slightly even with the new features.

.IP \(bu 2
fish now runs syntax highlighting in a background thread, so typing
commands is always responsive even on slow filesystems.
.IP \(bu 2
echo, test, and pwd are now builtins, which eliminates many forks.
.IP \(bu 2
The files in share/functions and share/completions now get
‘internalized’ into C strings that get compiled in with fish. This
substantially reduces the number of files touched at startup. A
consequence is that you cannot change these functions without
recompiling, but often other functions depend on these “standard”
functions, so changing them is perhaps not a good idea anyways.

Here are some system call counts for launching and then exiting fish
with the default configuration, on OS X. The first column is fish trunk,
the next column is with our changes, and the last column is bash for
comparison. This data was collected via dtrace.

The large number of forks relative to bash are due to fish’s insanely
expensive default prompt, which is unchanged in my version. If we switch
to a prompt comparable to bash’s (lame) default, the forks drop to 16
with trunk, 4 after our changes.
.sp
The large reduction in lstat() numbers is due to fish no longer needing
to call ttyname() on OS X.
.sp
We’ve got some work to do to be as lean as bash, but we’re on the right
track.
