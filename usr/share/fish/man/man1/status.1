.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
With no arguments, \fBstatus\fP displays a summary of the current login and job control status of the shell.
.sp
The following operations (subcommands) are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fBis\-command\-substitution\fP, \fB\-c\fP or \fB\-\-is\-command\-substitution\fP
Returns 0 if fish is currently executing a command substitution.
.TP
\fBis\-block\fP, \fB\-b\fP or \fB\-\-is\-block\fP
Returns 0 if fish is currently executing a block of code.
.TP
\fBis\-breakpoint\fP
Returns 0 if fish is currently showing a prompt in the context of a breakpoint \%<> command. See also the fish_breakpoint_prompt \%<> function.
.TP
\fBis\-interactive\fP, \fB\-i\fP or \fB\-\-is\-interactive\fP
Returns 0 if fish is interactive \- that is, connected to a keyboard.
.TP
\fBis\-interactive\-read\fP or \fB\-\-is\-interactive\-read\fP
Returns 0 if fish is running an interactive read \%<> builtin which is connected to a keyboard.
.TP
\fBis\-login\fP, \fB\-l\fP or \fB\-\-is\-login\fP
Returns 0 if fish is a login shell \- that is, if fish should perform login tasks such as setting up \fBPATH\fP \%<#\:envvar-PATH>\&.
.TP
\fBis\-full\-job\-control\fP or \fB\-\-is\-full\-job\-control\fP
Returns 0 if full job control is enabled.
.TP
\fBis\-interactive\-job\-control\fP or \fB\-\-is\-interactive\-job\-control\fP
Returns 0 if interactive job control is enabled.
.TP
\fBis\-no\-job\-control\fP or \fB\-\-is\-no\-job\-control\fP
Returns 0 if no job control is enabled.
.TP
\fBcurrent\-command\fP
Prints the name of the currently\-running function or command, like the deprecated \fB_\fP \%<#\:envvar-_> variable.
.TP
\fBcurrent\-commandline\fP
Prints the entirety of the currently\-running commandline, inclusive of all jobs and operators.
.TP
\fBfilename\fP, \fBcurrent\-filename\fP, \fB\-f\fP or \fB\-\-current\-filename\fP
Prints the filename of the currently\-running script. If the current script was called via a symlink, this will return the symlink. If the current script was received by piping into source \%<>, then this will return \fB\-\fP\&.
.TP
\fBbasename\fP
Prints just the filename of the running script, without any path components before.
.TP
\fBdirname\fP
Prints just the path to the running script, without the actual filename itself. This can be relative to \fBPWD\fP \%<#\:envvar-PWD> (including just \(dq.\(dq), depending on how the script was called. This is the same as passing the filename to \fBdirname(3)\fP\&. It\(aqs useful if you want to use other files in the current script\(aqs directory or similar.
.TP
\fBfish\-path\fP
Prints the absolute path to the currently executing instance of fish. This is a best\-effort attempt and the exact output is down to what the platform gives fish. In some cases you might only get \(dqfish\(dq.
.TP
\fBfunction\fP or \fBcurrent\-function\fP
Prints the name of the currently called function if able, when missing displays \(dqNot a function\(dq (or equivalent translated string).
.TP
\fBline\-number\fP, \fBcurrent\-line\-number\fP, \fB\-n\fP or \fB\-\-current\-line\-number\fP
Prints the line number of the currently running script.
.TP
\fBstack\-trace\fP, \fBprint\-stack\-trace\fP, \fB\-t\fP or \fB\-\-print\-stack\-trace\fP
Prints a stack trace of all function calls on the call stack.
.TP
\fBjob\-control\fP, \fB\-j\fP or \fB\-\-job\-control\fP \fICONTROL_TYPE\fP
Sets the job control type to \fICONTROL_TYPE\fP, which can be \fBnone\fP, \fBfull\fP, or \fBinteractive\fP\&.
.TP
\fBfeatures\fP
Lists all available feature flags \%<#\:featureflags>\&.
.TP
\fBtest\-feature\fP \fIFEATURE\fP
Returns 0 when FEATURE is enabled, 1 if it is disabled, and 2 if it is not recognized.
.TP
\fBbuild\-info\fP
This prints information on how fish was build \- which architecture, which build system or profile was used, etc.
This is mainly useful for debugging.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fBget\-file\fP \fIFILE\fP
NOTE: this subcommand is mainly intended for fish\(aqs internal use; let us know if you want to use it elsewhere.
.sp
This prints a file embedded in the fish binary at compile time. This includes the default set of functions and completions,
as well as the man pages and themes. Which files are included depends on build settings.
Returns 0 if the file was included, 1 otherwise.
.TP
\fBlist\-files\fP \fIFILE\fP
NOTE: this subcommand is mainly intended for fish\(aqs internal use; let us know if you want to use it elsewhere.
.sp
This lists the files embedded in the fish binary at compile time. Only files where the path starts with the optional \fIFILE\fP argument are shown.
Returns 0 if something was printed, 1 otherwise.
.TP
\fBhelp\-sections\fP
NOTE: this subcommand is intended for fish\(aqs internal use.
.sp
List section arguments for the help \%<> command.
If you have the latest version of fish, these URL fragments are valid on \%<https://\:fishshell\:.com/\:docs/\:current/>\&.
Always returns 0.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fBterminal\fP
Prints the name and version of the terminal fish is running inside (for example as reported via XTVERSION \%<#\:term-compat-xtversion>).
This is not available during early startup but only starting from when the first interactive prompt is shown, possibly via builtin read \%<>,
so before the first \fBfish_prompt\fP or \fBfish_read\fP event \%<#\:event>\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fBtest\-terminal\-feature\fP \fIFEATURE\fP
Returns 0 when the terminal was detected \%<#\:term-compat-xtgettcap> to support the given feature.
Like status terminal, this only works once the first interactive prompt is shown.
.sp
Currently the only available \fIFEATURE\fP is scroll\-content\-up \%<#\:term-compat-indn>\&.
An error will be printed when passed an unrecognized feature.
.UNINDENT
.SH NOTES
.sp
For backwards compatibility most subcommands can also be specified as a long or short option. For example, rather than \fBstatus is\-login\fP you can type \fBstatus \-\-is\-login\fP\&. The flag forms are deprecated and may be removed in a future release.
.sp
You can only specify one subcommand per invocation even if you use the flag form of the subcommand.
