.TH "STRING-JOIN0" "1" "Nov 14, 2025" "4.2" "fish-shell"
.SH NAME
string-join0 \- join strings with zero bytes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBstring\fP \fBjoin\fP [\fB\-q\fP | \fB\-\-quiet\fP] [\fB\-n\fP | \fB\-\-no\-empty\fP] [\fB\-\-\fP] \fISEP\fP [\fISTRING\fP \&...]
\fBstring\fP \fBjoin0\fP [\fB\-q\fP | \fB\-\-quiet\fP] [\fB\-n\fP | \fB\-\-no\-empty\fP] [\fB\-\-\fP] [\fISTRING\fP \&...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Joins its \fISTRING\fP arguments into a single string separated by \fISEP\fP (for \fBstring join\fP) or by the
zero byte (NUL) (for \fBstring join0\fP).
Exit status: 0 if at least one join was performed, or 1 otherwise.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-n\fP, \fB\-\-no\-empty\fP
Exclude empty strings from consideration (e.g. \fBstring join \-n + a b \(dq\(dq c\fP would expand to \fBa+b+c\fP not \fBa+b++c\fP).
.TP
\fB\-q\fP, \fB\-\-quiet\fP
Do not print the strings, only set the exit status as described above.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBWARNING\fP:
Insert a  \fB\-\-\fP before positional arguments to prevent them from being interpreted as flags.
Otherwise, any strings starting with \fB\-\fP will be treated as flag arguments, meaning they will most likely result in the command failing.
This is also true if you specify a variable which expands to such a string instead of a literal string.
If you don\(aqt need to append flag arguments at the end of the command,
just always use \fB\-\-\fP to avoid unwelcome surprises.
.sp
\fBstring join0\fP adds a trailing NUL. This is most useful in conjunction with tools that accept NUL\-delimited input, such as \fBsort \-z\fP\&.
.sp
Because Unix uses NUL as the string terminator, passing the output of \fBstring join0\fP as an \fIargument\fP to a command (via a command substitution \%<#\:expand-command-substitution>) won\(aqt actually work.
Fish will pass the correct bytes along, but the command won\(aqt be able to tell where the argument ends.
This is a limitation of Unix\(aq argument passing.
