.sp
This is the documentation for \fBfish\fP, the \fBf\fPriendly \fBi\fPnteractive \fBsh\fPell.
.sp
A shell is a program that helps you operate your computer by starting other programs. fish offers a command\-line interface focused on usability and interactive use.
.sp
Some of the special features of fish are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBExtensive UI\fP: Syntax highlighting \%<#\:syntax-highlighting>, Autosuggestions \%<#\:autosuggestions>, tab completion \%<#\:tab-completion> and selection lists that can be navigated and filtered.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBNo configuration needed\fP: fish is designed to be ready to use immediately, without requiring extensive configuration.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBEasy scripting\fP: New functions \%<#\:syntax-function> can be added on the fly. The syntax is easy to learn and use.
.UNINDENT
.sp
This page explains how to install and set up fish and where to get more information.
.SH WHERE TO GO?
.sp
If this is your first time using fish, see the tutorial \%<>\&.
.sp
If you are already familiar with other shells like bash and want to see the scripting differences, see Fish For Bash Users \%<>\&.
.sp
For an overview of fish\(aqs scripting language, see The Fish Language \%<>\&. If it would be useful in a script file, it\(aqs here.
.sp
For information on using fish interactively, see Interactive use \%<>\&. If it\(aqs about key presses, syntax highlighting or anything else that needs an interactive terminal session, look here.
.sp
If you need to install fish first, read on, the rest of this document will tell you how to get, install and configure fish.
.SH SETUP
.sp
This section describes how to install, uninstall, start, and exit \fBfish\fP\&. It also explains how to make fish the default shell.
.SS Installation
.sp
Up\-to\-date instructions for installing the latest version of fish are on the fish homepage \%<https://\:fishshell\:.com/>\&.
.sp
To install the development version of fish, see the instructions on the project\(aqs GitHub page \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell>\&.
.SS Starting and Exiting
.sp
Once fish has been installed, open a terminal. If fish is not the default shell:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Type \fBfish\fP to start a shell:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> fish
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
Type \fBexit\fP to end the session:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> exit
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Default Shell
.sp
There are multiple ways to switch to fish (or any other shell) as your default.
.sp
The simplest method is to set your terminal emulator (e.g. GNOME Terminal, Apple\(aqs Terminal.app, or Konsole) to start fish directly. See its configuration and set the program to start to \fB/usr/local/bin/fish\fP (the exact path depends on how you installed fish).
.sp
Alternatively, you can set fish as your login shell so that it will be started by all terminal logins, including SSH.
.sp
\fBWarning:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Setting fish as your login shell may cause issues, such as an incorrect \fBPATH\fP \%<#\:envvar-PATH>\&. Some operating systems, including a number of Linux distributions, require the login shell to be Bourne\-compatible and to read configuration from \fB/etc/profile\fP\&. fish may not be suitable as a login shell on these systems.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To change your login shell to fish:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Add the shell to \fB/etc/shells\fP with:
.INDENT 3.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> command \-v fish | sudo tee \-a /etc/shells
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP 2. 3
Change your default shell with:
.INDENT 3.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> chsh \-s \(dq$(command \-v fish)\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To change it back to another shell, substitute \fBfish\fP with \fBbash\fP, \fBtcsh\fP or \fBzsh\fP as appropriate in the above command.
.SS Uninstalling
.sp
For uninstalling fish: see FAQ: Uninstalling fish \%<#\:faq-uninstalling>\&.
.SS Shebang Line
.sp
Because shell scripts are written in many different languages, they need to carry information about which interpreter should be used to execute them. For this, they are expected to have a first line, the shebang line, which names the interpreter executable.
.sp
A script written in \fBbash\fP would need a first line like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
#!/bin/bash
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When the shell tells the kernel to execute the file, it will use the interpreter \fB/bin/bash\fP\&.
.sp
For a script written in another language, just replace \fB/bin/bash\fP with the interpreter for that language. For example: \fB/usr/bin/python\fP for a python script, or \fB/usr/local/bin/fish\fP for a fish script, if that is where you have them installed.
.sp
If you want to share your script with others, you might want to use \fBenv\fP to allow for the interpreter to be installed in other locations. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
#!/usr/bin/env fish
echo Hello from fish $version
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will call \fBenv\fP, which then goes through \fBPATH\fP \%<#\:envvar-PATH> to find a program called \(dqfish\(dq. This makes it work, whether fish is installed in (for example) \fB/usr/local/bin/fish\fP, \fB/usr/bin/fish\fP, or \fB~/.local/bin/fish\fP, as long as that directory is in \fBPATH\fP \%<#\:envvar-PATH>\&.
.sp
The shebang line is only used when scripts are executed without specifying the interpreter. For functions inside fish or when executing a script with \fBfish /path/to/script\fP, a shebang is not required (but it doesn\(aqt hurt!).
.sp
When executing files without an interpreter, fish, like other shells, tries your system shell, typically \fB/bin/sh\fP\&. This is needed because some scripts are shipped without a shebang line.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.sp
To store configuration write it to a file called \fB~/.config/fish/config.fish\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\&.fish\fP scripts in \fB~/.config/fish/conf.d/\fP are also automatically executed before \fBconfig.fish\fP\&.
.sp
These files are read on the startup of every shell, whether interactive and/or if they\(aqre login shells. Use \fBstatus \-\-is\-interactive\fP and \fBstatus \-\-is\-login\fP to do things only in interactive/login shells, respectively.
.sp
This is the short version; for a full explanation, like for sysadmins or integration for developers of other software, see Configuration files \%<#\:configuration>\&.
.sp
If you want to see what you changed over fish\(aqs defaults, see fish_delta \%<>\&.
.SS Examples:
.sp
To add \fB~/linux/bin\fP to PATH variable when using a login shell, add this to \fB~/.config/fish/config.fish\fP file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
if status \-\-is\-login
    set \-gx PATH $PATH ~/linux/bin
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is just an example; using fish_add_path \%<> e.g. \fBfish_add_path ~/linux/bin\fP which only adds the path if it isn\(aqt included yet is easier.
.sp
To run commands on exit, use an event handler \%<#\:event> that is triggered by the exit of the shell:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
function on_exit \-\-on\-event fish_exit
    echo fish is now exiting

.SH OTHER HELP PAGES
.SS Frequently asked questions
.SS What is the equivalent to this thing from bash (or other shells)?
.sp
See Fish for bash users \%<>
.SS How do I set or clear an environment variable?
.sp
Use the set \%<> command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set \-x key value # typically set \-gx key value
set \-e key
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Since fish 3.1 you can set an environment variable for one command using the \fBkey=value some command\fP syntax, like in other shells.  The two lines below behave identically \- unlike other shells, fish will output \fBvalue\fP both times:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
key=value echo $key
begin; set \-lx key value; echo $key; end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that \(dqexported\(dq is not a scope \%<#\:variables-scope>, but an additional bit of state. A variable can be global and exported or local and exported or even universal and exported. Typically it makes sense to make an exported variable global.
.SS How do I check whether a variable is defined?
.sp
Use \fBset \-q var\fP\&.  For example, \fBif set \-q var; echo variable defined; end\fP\&.  To check multiple variables you can combine with \fBand\fP and \fBor\fP like so:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
if set \-q var1; or set \-q var2
    echo either variable defined
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Keep in mind that a defined variable could also be empty, either by having no elements (if set like \fBset var\fP) or only empty elements (if set like \fBset var \(dq\(dq\fP). Read on for how to deal with those.
.SS How do I check whether a variable is not empty?
.sp
Use \fBstring length \-q \-\- $var\fP\&.  For example, \fBif string length \-q \-\- $var; echo not empty; end\fP\&.  Note that \fBstring length\fP will interpret a list of multiple variables as a disjunction (meaning any/or):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
if string length \-q \-\- $var1 $var2 $var3
    echo at least one of these variables is not empty
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Alternatively, use \fBtest \-n \(dq$var\(dq\fP, but remember that \fBthe variable must be double\-quoted\fP\&.  For example, \fBif test \-n \(dq$var\(dq; echo not empty; end\fP\&. The \fBtest\fP command provides its own and (\-a) and or (\-o):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
if test \-n \(dq$var1\(dq \-o \-n \(dq$var2\(dq \-o \-n \(dq$var3\(dq
    echo at least one of these variables is not empty
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you want to know if a variable has \fIno elements\fP, use \fBset \-q var[1]\fP\&.
.SS Why doesn\(aqt \fBset \-Ux\fP (exported universal variables) seem to work?
.sp
A global variable of the same name already exists.
.sp
Environment variables such as \fBEDITOR\fP or \fBTZ\fP can be set universally using \fBset \-Ux\fP\&.  However, if
there is an environment variable already set before fish starts (such as by login scripts or system
administrators), it is imported into fish as a global variable. The variable scopes \%<#\:variables-scope> are searched from the \(dqinside out\(dq, which
means that local variables are checked first, followed by global variables, and finally universal
variables.
.sp
This means that the global value takes precedence over the universal value.
.sp
To avoid this problem, consider changing the setting which fish inherits. If this is not possible,
add a statement to your configuration file \%<#\:configuration> (usually
\fB~/.config/fish/config.fish\fP):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set \-gx EDITOR vim
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS How do I run a command every login? What\(aqs fish\(aqs equivalent to .bashrc or .profile?
.sp
Edit the file \fB~/.config/fish/config.fish\fP [1], creating it if it does not exist (Note the leading period).
.sp
Unlike .bashrc and .profile, this file is always read, even in non\-interactive or login shells.
.sp
To do something only in interactive shells, check \fBstatus is\-interactive\fP like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
if status is\-interactive
    # use the coolbeans theme
    fish_config theme choose coolbeans
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP [1] 5
The \(dq~/.config\(dq part of this can be set via $XDG_CONFIG_HOME, that\(aqs just the default.
.SS How do I set my prompt?
.sp
The prompt is the output of the \fBfish_prompt\fP function. Put it in \fB~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish\fP\&. For example, a simple prompt is:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
function fish_prompt
    set_color $fish_color_cwd
    echo \-n (prompt_pwd)
    set_color normal
    echo \-n \(aq > \(aq
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can also use the Web configuration tool, fish_config \%<>, to preview and choose from a gallery of sample prompts.
.sp
Or you can use fish_config from the commandline:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> fish_config prompt show
# displays all the prompts fish ships with
> fish_config prompt choose disco
# loads the disco prompt in the current shell
> fish_config prompt save
# makes the change permanent
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you want to modify your existing prompt, you can use funced \%<> and funcsave \%<> like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
>_ funced fish_prompt
# This opens up your editor (set in $EDITOR).
# Modify the function,
# save the file and repeat to your liking.
# Once you are happy with it:
>_ funcsave fish_prompt
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This also applies to fish_right_prompt \%<> and fish_mode_prompt \%<>\&.
.SS Why does my prompt show a \fB[I]\fP?
.sp
That\(aqs the fish_mode_prompt \%<>\&. It is displayed by default when you\(aqve activated vi mode using \fBfish_vi_key_bindings\fP\&.
.sp
If you haven\(aqt activated vi mode on purpose, you might have installed a third\-party theme or plugin that does it.
.sp
If you want to change or disable this display, modify the \fBfish_mode_prompt\fP function, for instance via funced \%<>\&.
.SS How do I customize my syntax highlighting colors?
.sp
Use the web configuration tool, fish_config \%<>, or alter the fish_color family of environment variables \%<#\:variables-color>\&.
.sp
You can also use \fBfish_config\fP on the commandline, like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> fish_config theme show
# to demonstrate all the colorschemes
> fish_config theme choose coolbeans
# to load the \(dqcoolbeans\(dq theme
> fish_config theme save
# to make the change permanent
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS How do I change the greeting message?
.sp
Change the value of the variable \fBfish_greeting\fP or create a fish_greeting \%<> function. For example, to remove the greeting use:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set \-U fish_greeting
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Or if you prefer not to use a universal variable, use:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set \-g fish_greeting
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
in config.fish \%<#\:configuration>\&.
.SS How do I run a command from history?
.sp
Type some part of the command, and then hit the \fBup\fP (\fB↑\fP) or \fBdown\fP (\fB↓\fP) arrow keys to navigate through history matches, or press \fBctrl\fP\-\fBr\fP to open the history in a searchable pager. In this pager you can press \fBctrl\fP\-\fBr\fP or \fBctrl\fP\-\fBs\fP to move to older or younger history respectively.
.sp
Additional default key bindings include \fBctrl\fP\-\fBp\fP (up) and \fBctrl\fP\-\fBn\fP (down). See Searchable command history \%<#\:history-search> for more information.
.SS Why doesn\(aqt history substitution (\(dq!$\(dq etc.) work?
.sp
Because history substitution is an awkward interface that was invented before interactive line editing was even possible. Instead of adding this pseudo\-syntax, fish opts for nice history searching and recall features.  Switching requires a small change of habits: if you want to modify an old line/word, first recall it, then edit.
.sp
As a special case, most of the time history substitution is used as \fBsudo !!\fP\&. In that case press \fBalt\fP\-\fBs\fP, and it will recall your last commandline with \fBsudo\fP prefixed (or toggle a \fBsudo\fP prefix on the current commandline if there is anything).
.sp
In general, fish\(aqs history recall works like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Like other shells, the Up arrow, \fBup\fP recalls whole lines, starting from the last executed line. So instead of typing \fB!!\fP, you would hit the up\-arrow.
.IP \(bu 2
If the line you want is far back in the history, type any part of the line and then press Up one or more times.  This will filter the recalled lines to ones that include this text, and you will get to the line you want much faster.  This replaces \(dq!vi\(dq, \(dq!?bar.c\(dq and the like. If you want to see more context, you can press \fBctrl\-r\fP to open the history in the pager.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBalt\-up\fP recalls individual arguments, starting from the last argument in the last executed line. This can be used instead of \(dq!$\(dq.
.UNINDENT
.sp
See documentation \%<#\:editor> for more details about line editing in fish.
.sp
That being said, you can use Abbreviations \%<#\:abbreviations> to implement history substitution. Here\(aqs \fB!!\fP only:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
function last_history_item; echo $history[1]; end
abbr \-a !! \-\-position anywhere \-\-function last_history_item
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Run this and \fB!!\fP will be replaced with the last history entry, anywhere on the commandline. Put it into config.fish \%<#\:configuration> to keep it.
.SS How do I run a subcommand? The backtick doesn\(aqt work!
.sp
\fBfish\fP uses parentheses for subcommands. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
for i in (ls)
    echo $i
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
It also supports the familiar \fB$()\fP syntax, even in quotes. Backticks are not supported because they are discouraged even in POSIX shells. They nest poorly and are hard to tell from single quotes (\fB\(aq\(aq\fP).
.SS My command (pkg\-config) gives its output as a single long string?
.sp
Unlike other shells, fish splits command substitutions only on newlines, not spaces or tabs or the characters in $IFS.
.sp
That means if you run
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
count (printf \(aq%s \(aq a b c)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
It will print \fB1\fP, because the \(dqa b c \(dq is used in one piece. But if you do
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
count (printf \(aq%s\en\(aq a b c)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
it will print \fB3\fP, because it gave \fBcount\fP the arguments \(dqa\(dq, \(dqb\(dq and \(dqc\(dq separately.
.sp
In the overwhelming majority of cases, splitting on spaces is unwanted, so this is an improvement. This is why you hear about problems with filenames with spaces, after all.
.sp
However sometimes, especially with \fBpkg\-config\fP and related tools, splitting on spaces is needed.
.sp
In these cases use \fBstring split \-n \(dq \(dq\fP like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
g++ example_01.cpp (pkg\-config \-\-cflags \-\-libs gtk+\-2.0 | string split \-n \(dq \(dq)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fB\-n\fP is so empty elements are removed like POSIX shells would do.
.SS How do I get the exit status of a command?
.sp
Use the \fB$status\fP variable. This replaces the \fB$?\fP variable used in other shells.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
somecommand
if test $status \-eq 7
    echo \(dqThat\(aqs my lucky number!\(dq
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you are only interested in success or failure, you can run the command directly as the if\-condition:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
if somecommand
    echo \(dqCommand succeeded\(dq
else
    echo \(dqCommand failed\(dq
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Or if you just want to do one command in case the first succeeded or failed, use \fBand\fP or \fBor\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
somecommand
or someothercommand
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
See the Conditions \%<#\:syntax-conditional> and the documentation for test \%<> and if \%<> for more information.
.SS My command prints \(dqNo matches for wildcard\(dq but works in bash
.sp
In short: quote \%<#\:quotes> or escape \%<#\:escapes> the wildcard:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
scp user@ip:/dir/\(dqstring\-*\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When fish sees an unquoted \fB*\fP, it performs wildcard expansion \%<#\:expand-wildcard>\&. That means it tries to match filenames to the given string.
.sp
If the wildcard doesn\(aqt match any files, fish prints an error instead of running the command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> echo *this*does*not*exist
fish: No matches for wildcard \(aq*this*does*not*exist\(aq. See \(gahelp expand\(ga.
echo *this*does*not*exist
     ^
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now, bash also tries to match files in this case, but when it doesn\(aqt find a match, it passes along the literal wildcard string instead.
.sp
That means that commands like the above
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
scp user@ip:/dir/string\-*
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
or
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
apt install postgres\-*
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
appear to work, because most of the time the string doesn\(aqt match and so it passes along the \fBstring\-*\fP, which is then interpreted by the receiving program.
.sp
But it also means that these commands can stop working at any moment once a matching file is encountered (because it has been created or the command is executed in a different working directory), and to deal with that bash needs workarounds like
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
for f in ./*.mpg; do
      # We need to test if the file really exists because
      # the wildcard might have failed to match.
      test \-f \(dq$f\(dq || continue
      mympgviewer \(dq$f\(dq
done
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
(from \%<http://\:mywiki\:.wooledge\:.org/\:BashFAQ/\:004>)
.sp
For these reasons, fish does not do this, and instead expects asterisks to be quoted or escaped if they aren\(aqt supposed to be expanded.
.sp
This is similar to bash\(aqs \(dqfailglob\(dq option.
.SS Why won\(aqt SSH/SCP/rsync connect properly when fish is my login shell?
.sp
This problem may show up as messages like \(dq\fBReceived message too long\fP\(dq, \(dq\fBopen terminal
failed: not a terminal\fP\(dq, \(dq\fBBad packet length\fP\(dq, or \(dq\fBConnection refused\fP\(dq with strange output
in \fBssh_exchange_identification\fP messages in the debug log.
.sp
This usually happens because fish reads the user configuration file \%<#\:configuration> (\fB~/.config/fish/config.fish\fP) \fIalways\fP,
whether it\(aqs in an interactive or login or non\-interactive or non\-login shell.
.sp
This simplifies matters, but it also means when config.fish generates output, it will do that even in non\-interactive shells like the one ssh/scp/rsync start when they connect.
.sp
Anything in config.fish that produces output should be guarded with \fBstatus is\-interactive\fP (or \fBstatus is\-login\fP if you prefer):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
if status is\-interactive
  ...
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The same applies for example when you start \fBtmux\fP in config.fish without guards, which will cause a message like \fBsessions should be nested with care, unset $TMUX to force\fP\&.
.SS I\(aqm getting weird graphical glitches (a staircase effect, ghost characters, cursor in the wrong position,...)?
.sp
In a terminal, the application running inside it and the terminal itself need to agree on the width of characters in order to handle cursor movement.
.sp
This is more important to fish than other shells because features like syntax highlighting and autosuggestions are implemented by moving the cursor.
.sp
Sometimes, there is disagreement on the width. There are numerous causes and fixes for this:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
It is possible the character is too new for your system to know \- in this case you need to refrain from using it.
.IP \(bu 2
Fish or your terminal might not know about the character or handle it wrong \- in this case fish or your terminal needs to be fixed, or you need to update to a fixed version.
.IP \(bu 2
The character has an \(dqambiguous\(dq width and fish thinks that means a width of X while your terminal thinks it\(aqs Y. In this case you either need to change your terminal\(aqs configuration or set $fish_ambiguous_width to the correct value.
.IP \(bu 2
The character is an emoji and the host system only supports Unicode 8, while you are running the terminal on a system that uses Unicode >= 9. In this case set $fish_emoji_width to 2.
.UNINDENT
.sp
This also means that a few things are unsupportable:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Non\-monospace fonts \- there is \fIno way\fP for fish to figure out what width a specific character has as it has no influence on the terminal\(aqs font rendering.
.IP \(bu 2
Different widths for multiple ambiguous width characters \- there is no way for fish to know which width you assign to each character.
.UNINDENT
.SS fish does not work in a specific terminal
.sp
The terminal might not meet all of fish\(aqs requirements \%<>\&.
Please report this to your terminal\(aqs and to fish\(aqs issue tracker.
.SS Uninstalling fish
.sp
If you want to uninstall fish, first make sure fish is not set as your shell. Run \fBchsh \-s /bin/bash\fP if you are not sure.
.sp
If you installed it with a package manager, use that package manager\(aqs uninstall function. If you built fish yourself, assuming you installed it to /usr/local, do this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
rm \-Rf /usr/local/etc/fish /usr/local/share/fish ~/.config/fish
rm /usr/local/share/man/man1/fish*.1
cd /usr/local/bin
rm \-f fish fish_indent
.EE

.SS Interactive use
.sp
Fish prides itself on being really nice to use interactively. That\(aqs down to a few features we\(aqll explain in the next few sections.
.sp
Fish is used by giving commands in the fish language, see The Fish Language \%<> for information on that.
.SS Help
.sp
Fish has an extensive help system. Use the help \%<> command to obtain help on a specific subject or command. For instance, writing \fBhelp syntax\fP displays the syntax section \%<#\:syntax> of this documentation.
.sp
Fish also has man pages for its commands, and translates the help pages to man pages. For example, \fBman set\fP will show the documentation for \fBset\fP as a man page.
.sp
Help on a specific builtin can also be obtained with the \fB\-h\fP parameter. For instance, to obtain help on the fg \%<> builtin, either type \fBfg \-h\fP or \fBhelp fg\fP\&.
.sp
The main page can be viewed via \fBhelp index\fP (or just \fBhelp\fP) or \fBman fish\-doc\fP\&. The tutorial can be viewed with \fBhelp tutorial\fP or \fBman fish\-tutorial\fP\&.
.SS Autosuggestions
.sp
fish suggests commands as you type, based on command history, completions, and valid file paths. As you type commands, you will see a suggestion offered after the cursor, in a muted gray color (which can be changed with the \fBfish_color_autosuggestion\fP variable).
.sp
To accept the autosuggestion (replacing the command line contents), press \fBright\fP (\fB→\fP) or \fBctrl\fP\-\fBf\fP\&. To accept the first suggested word, press \fBalt\fP\-\fBright\fP (\fB→\fP) or \fBalt\fP\-\fBf\fP\&. If the autosuggestion is not what you want, ignore it: it won\(aqt execute unless you accept it.
.sp
Autosuggestions are a powerful way to quickly summon frequently entered commands, by typing the first few characters. They are also an efficient technique for navigating through directory hierarchies.
.sp
If you don\(aqt like autosuggestions, you can disable them by setting \fB$fish_autosuggestion_enabled\fP to 0:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set \-g fish_autosuggestion_enabled 0
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Tab Completion
.sp
Tab completion is a time saving feature of any modern shell. When you type \fBtab\fP, fish tries to guess the rest of the word under the cursor. If it finds exactly one possibility, it inserts it. If it finds more, it inserts the longest unambiguous part and then opens a menu (the \(dqpager\(dq) that you can navigate to find what you\(aqre looking for.
.sp
The pager can be navigated with the arrow keys, \fBpageup\fP / \fBpagedown\fP, \fBtab\fP or \fBshift\fP\-\fBtab\fP\&. Pressing \fBctrl\fP\-\fBs\fP (the \fBpager\-toggle\-search\fP binding \- \fB/\fP in vi mode) opens up a search menu that you can use to filter the list.
.sp
Fish provides some general purpose completions, like for commands, variable names, usernames or files.
.sp
It also provides a large number of program specific scripted completions. Most of these completions are simple options like the \fB\-l\fP option for \fBls\fP, but a lot are more advanced. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBman\fP and \fBwhatis\fP show the installed manual pages as completions.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmake\fP uses targets in the Makefile in the current directory as completions.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmount\fP uses mount points specified in fstab as completions.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBapt\fP, \fBrpm\fP and \fByum\fP show installed or installable packages
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can also write your own completions or install some you got from someone else. For that, see Writing your own completions \%<>\&.
.sp
Completion scripts are loaded on demand, like functions are \%<#\:syntax-function-autoloading>\&. The difference is the \fB$fish_complete_path\fP list \%<#\:variables-lists> is used instead of \fB$fish_function_path\fP\&. Typically you can drop new completions in ~/.config/fish/completions/name\-of\-command.fish and fish will find them automatically.
.SS Syntax highlighting
.sp
Fish interprets the command line as it is typed and uses syntax highlighting to provide feedback. The most important feedback is the detection of potential errors. By default, errors are marked red.
.sp
Detected errors include:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Non\-existing commands.
.IP \(bu 2
Reading from or appending to a non\-existing file.
.IP \(bu 2
Incorrect use of output redirects
.IP \(bu 2
Mismatched parenthesis
.UNINDENT
.sp
To customize the syntax highlighting, you can set the environment variables listed in the Variables for changing highlighting colors section.
.sp
Fish also provides pre\-made color themes you can pick with fish_config \%<>\&. Running just \fBfish_config\fP opens a browser interface, or you can use \fBfish_config theme\fP in the terminal.
.sp
For example, to disable nearly all coloring:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
fish_config theme choose None
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Or, to see all themes, right in your terminal:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
fish_config theme show
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Syntax highlighting variables
.sp
The colors used by fish for syntax highlighting can be configured by changing the values of various variables. The value of these variables can be one of the colors accepted by the set_color \%<> command.
Options accepted by \fBset_color\fP like
\fB\-\-background=\fP,
\fB\-\-bold\fP,
\fB\-\-dim\fP,
\fB\-\-italics\fP,
\fB\-\-reverse\fP,
\fB\-\-underline\fP and
\fB\-\-underline\-color=\fP
are also accepted.
.sp
Example: to make errors highlighted and red, use:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set fish_color_error red \-\-bold
.EE
.UNINDENT

.IP \(bu 2
For \fB$fish_color_valid_path\fP, if that doesn\(aqt have a color, but only modifiers, it adds those to the color that would otherwise be used,

When the secondary or selected variables aren\(aqt set or are empty, the normal variables are used, except for \fB$fish_pager_color_selected_background\fP, where the background of \fB$fish_color_search_match\fP is tried first.
.SS Abbreviations
.sp
To avoid needless typing, a frequently\-run command like \fBgit checkout\fP can be abbreviated to \fBgco\fP using the abbr \%<> command.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
abbr \-a gco git checkout
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
After entering \fBgco\fP and pressing \fBspace\fP or \fBenter\fP, a \fBgco\fP in command position will turn into \fBgit checkout\fP in the command line. If you want to use a literal \fBgco\fP sometimes, use \fBctrl\fP\-\fBspace\fP [1]\&.
.sp
Abbreviations are a lot more powerful than just replacing literal strings. For example you can make going up a number of directories easier with this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
function multicd
    echo cd (string repeat \-n (math (string length \-\- $argv[1]) \- 1) ../)
end
abbr \-\-add dotdot \-\-regex \(aq^\e.\e.+$\(aq \-\-function multicd
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now, \fB\&..\fP transforms to \fBcd ../\fP, while \fB\&...\fP turns into \fBcd ../../\fP and \fB\&....\fP expands to \fBcd ../../../\fP\&.
.sp
The advantage over aliases is that you can see the actual command before using it, add to it or change it, and the actual command will be stored in history.
.IP [1] 5
Any binding that executes the \fBexpand\-abbr\fP or \fBexecute\fP bind function \%<> will expand abbreviations. By default \fBctrl\fP\-\fBspace\fP is bound to just inserting a space.
.SS Programmable prompt
.sp
When it is fish\(aqs turn to ask for input (like after it started or the command ended), it will show a prompt. Often this looks something like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
you@hostname ~>
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This prompt is determined by running the fish_prompt \%<> and fish_right_prompt \%<> functions.
.sp
The output of the former is displayed on the left and the latter\(aqs output on the right side of the terminal.
For vi mode, the output of fish_mode_prompt \%<> will be prepended on the left.
.sp
If \fBfish_transient_prompt\fP \%<#\:envvar-fish_transient_prompt> is set to 1, fish will redraw the prompt with a \fB\-\-final\-rendering\fP argument before running a commandline, allowing you to change it before pushing it to the scrollback.
.sp
Fish ships with a few prompts which you can see with fish_config \%<>\&. If you run just \fBfish_config\fP it will open a web interface [2] where you\(aqll be shown the prompts and can pick which one you want. \fBfish_config prompt show\fP will show you the prompts right in your terminal.
.sp
For example \fBfish_config prompt choose disco\fP will temporarily select the \(dqdisco\(dq prompt. If you like it and decide to keep it, run \fBfish_config prompt save\fP\&.
.sp
You can also change these functions yourself by running \fBfunced fish_prompt\fP and \fBfuncsave fish_prompt\fP once you are happy with the result (or \fBfish_right_prompt\fP if you want to change that).
.IP [2] 5
The web interface runs purely locally on your computer and requires python to be installed.
.SS Configurable greeting
.sp
When it is started interactively, fish tries to run the fish_greeting \%<> function. The default fish_greeting prints a simple message. You can change its text by changing the \fB$fish_greeting\fP variable, for instance using a universal variable \%<#\:variables-universal>:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set \-U fish_greeting
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
or you can set it globally \%<#\:variables-scope> in config.fish \%<#\:configuration>:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set \-g fish_greeting \(aqHey, stranger!\(aq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
or you can script it by changing the function:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
function fish_greeting
    random choice \(dqHello!\(dq \(dqHi\(dq \(dqG\(aqday\(dq \(dqHowdy\(dq
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
save this in config.fish or a function file \%<#\:syntax-function-autoloading>\&. You can also use funced \%<> and funcsave \%<> to edit it easily.
.SS Programmable title
.sp
Most terminals allow setting the text displayed in the titlebar of the terminal window.
Fish does this by running the fish_title \%<> function.
It is executed before and after a command and the output is used as a titlebar message.
.sp
The status current\-command \%<> builtin will always return the name of the job to be put into the foreground (or \fBfish\fP if control is returning to the shell) when the fish_title \%<> function is called. The first argument will contain the most recently executed foreground command as a string.
.sp
The default title shows the hostname if connected via ssh, the currently running command (unless it is fish) and the current working directory. All of this is shortened to not make the tab too wide.
.sp
Examples:
.sp
To show the last command and working directory in the title:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
function fish_title
    # \(gaprompt_pwd\(ga shortens the title. This helps prevent tabs from becoming very wide.
    echo $argv[1] (prompt_pwd)
    pwd
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Command line editor
.sp
The fish editor features copy and paste, a searchable history and many editor functions that can be bound to special keyboard shortcuts.
.sp
Like bash and other shells, fish includes two sets of keyboard shortcuts (or key bindings): one inspired by the Emacs text editor, and one by the vi text editor. The default editing mode is Emacs. You can switch to vi mode by running fish_vi_key_bindings \%<> and switch back with fish_default_key_bindings \%<>\&. You can also make your own key bindings by creating a function and setting the \fBfish_key_bindings\fP variable to its name. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
function fish_hybrid_key_bindings \-\-description \e
\(dqVi\-style bindings that inherit emacs\-style bindings in all modes\(dq
    for mode in default insert visual
        fish_default_key_bindings \-M $mode
    end
    fish_vi_key_bindings \-\-no\-erase
end
set \-g fish_key_bindings fish_hybrid_key_bindings
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
While the key bindings included with fish include many of the shortcuts popular from the respective text editors, they are not a complete implementation. They include a shortcut to open the current command line in your preferred editor (\fBalt\fP\-\fBe\fP by default) if you need the full power of your editor.
.SS Shared bindings
.sp
Some bindings are common across Emacs and vi mode, because they aren\(aqt text editing bindings, or because what vi/Vim does for a particular key doesn\(aqt make sense for a shell.

You can change these key bindings using the bind \%<> builtin.
.SS Vi mode commands
.sp
Vi mode allows for the use of vi\-like commands at the prompt. Initially, insert mode is active. \fBescape\fP enters command mode\&. The commands available in command, insert and visual mode are described below. Vi mode shares some bindings with Emacs mode\&.
.sp
To enable vi mode, use fish_vi_key_bindings \%<>\&.
It is also possible to add all Emacs mode bindings to vi mode by using something like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
function fish_user_key_bindings
    # Execute this once per mode that emacs bindings should be used in
    fish_default_key_bindings \-M insert

    # Then execute the vi\-bindings so they take precedence when there\(aqs a conflict.
    # Without \-\-no\-erase fish_vi_key_bindings will default to
    # resetting all bindings.
    # The argument specifies the initial mode (insert, \(dqdefault\(dq or visual).
    fish_vi_key_bindings \-\-no\-erase insert
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When in vi mode, the fish_mode_prompt \%<> function will display a mode indicator to the left of the prompt. To disable this feature, override it with an empty function. To display the mode elsewhere (like in your right prompt), use the output of the \fBfish_default_mode_prompt\fP function.
.sp
When a binding switches the mode, it will repaint the mode\-prompt if it exists, and the rest of the prompt only if it doesn\(aqt. So if you want a mode\-indicator in your \fBfish_prompt\fP, you need to erase \fBfish_mode_prompt\fP e.g. by adding an empty file at \fB~/.config/fish/functions/fish_mode_prompt.fish\fP\&. (Bindings that change the mode are supposed to call the \fIrepaint\-mode\fP bind function, see bind \%<>)
.sp
The \fBfish_vi_cursor\fP function will be used to change the cursor\(aqs shape depending on the mode in supported terminals. The following snippet can be used to manually configure cursors after enabling vi mode:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# Emulates vim\(aqs cursor shape behavior
# Set the normal and visual mode cursors to a block
set fish_cursor_default block
# Set the insert mode cursor to a line
set fish_cursor_insert line
# Set the replace mode cursors to an underscore
set fish_cursor_replace_one underscore
set fish_cursor_replace underscore
# Set the external cursor to a line. The external cursor appears when a command is started.
# The cursor shape takes the value of fish_cursor_default when fish_cursor_external is not specified.
set fish_cursor_external line
# The following variable can be used to configure cursor shape in
# visual mode, but due to fish_cursor_default, is redundant here
set fish_cursor_visual block
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Additionally, \fBblink\fP can be added after each of the cursor shape parameters to set a blinking cursor in the specified shape.
.sp
Fish knows the shapes \(dqblock\(dq, \(dqline\(dq and \(dqunderscore\(dq, other values will be ignored.
.sp
If the cursor shape does not appear to be changing after setting the above variables, it\(aqs likely your terminal emulator does not support the capabilities necessary to do this.

In addition to the standard bindings listed here, you can also define your own with bind \%<>:

.EX
# Prints \(ga\(ga^C\(ga\(ga and a new prompt

.EE
.UNINDENT

Put \fBbind\fP statements into config.fish \%<#\:configuration> or a function called \fBfish_user_key_bindings\fP\&.

If you change your mind on a binding and want to go back to fish\(aqs default, you can erase it again:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
bind \-\-erase ctrl\-c
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Fish remembers its preset bindings and so it will take effect again. This saves you from having to remember what it was before and add it again yourself.
.sp
If you use vi bindings, note that \fBbind\fP will by default bind keys in command mode\&. To bind something in insert mode:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
bind \-\-mode insert ctrl\-c \(aqcommandline \-r \(dq\(dq\(aq

.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that the historical way the terminal encodes keys and sends them to the application (fish, in this case) makes a lot of combinations indistinguishable or unbindable. In the usual encoding, \fBctrl\fP\-\fBi\fP \fIis the same\fP as the tab key, and shift cannot be detected when ctrl is also pressed.
.sp
There are more powerful encoding schemes, and fish tries to tell the terminal to turn them on, but there are still many terminals that do not support them. When \fBfish_key_reader\fP prints the same sequence for two different keys, then that is because your terminal sends the same sequence for them, and there isn\(aqt anything fish can do about it. It is our hope that these schemes will become more widespread, making input more flexible.
.sp
In the historical scheme, \fBescape\fP is the same thing as \fBalt\fP in a terminal. To distinguish between pressing \fBescape\fP and then another key, and pressing \fBalt\fP and that key (or an escape sequence the key sends), fish waits for a certain time after seeing an escape character. This is configurable via the \fBfish_escape_delay_ms\fP \%<#\:envvar-fish_escape_delay_ms> variable.
.sp
If you want to be able to press \fBescape\fP and then a character and have it count as \fBalt\fP+that character, set it to a higher value, e.g.:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set \-g fish_escape_delay_ms 100
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Similarly, to disambiguate \fIother\fP keypresses where you\(aqve bound a subsequence and a longer sequence, fish has \fBfish_sequence_key_delay_ms\fP \%<#\:envvar-fish_sequence_key_delay_ms>:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# This binds the sequence j,k to switch to normal mode in vi mode.
# If you kept it like that, every time you press \(dqj\(dq,
# fish would wait for a \(dqk\(dq or other key to disambiguate
bind \-M insert \-m default j,k cancel repaint\-mode

# After setting this, fish only waits 200ms for the \(dqk\(dq,
# or decides to treat the \(dqj\(dq as a separate sequence, inserting it.
set \-g fish_sequence_key_delay_ms 200

.UNINDENT
.SS Copy and paste (Kill Ring)
.sp
Fish uses an Emacs\-style kill ring for copy and paste functionality. For example, use \fBctrl\fP\-\fBk\fP (\fIkill\-line\fP) to cut from the current cursor position to the end of the line. The string that is cut (a.k.a. killed in emacs\-ese) is inserted into a list of kills, called the kill ring. To paste the latest value from the kill ring (emacs calls this \(dqyanking\(dq) use \fBctrl\fP\-\fBy\fP (the \fByank\fP input function). After pasting, use \fBalt\fP\-\fBy\fP (\fByank\-pop\fP) to rotate to the previous kill.
.sp
Copy and paste from outside are also supported, both via the \fBctrl\fP\-\fBx\fP / \fBctrl\fP\-\fBv\fP bindings (the \fBfish_clipboard_copy\fP and \fBfish_clipboard_paste\fP functions [3]) and via the terminal\(aqs paste function, for which fish enables \(dqBracketed Paste Mode\(dq, so it can tell a paste from manually entered text.
In addition, when pasting inside single quotes, pasted single quotes and backslashes are automatically escaped so that the result can be used as a single token by closing the quote after.
Kill ring entries are stored in \fBfish_killring\fP variable.
.sp
The commands \fBbegin\-selection\fP and \fBend\-selection\fP (unbound by default; used for selection in vi visual mode) control text selection together with cursor movement commands that extend the current selection.
The variable \fBfish_cursor_selection_mode\fP \%<#\:envvar-fish_cursor_selection_mode> can be used to configure if that selection should include the character under the cursor (\fBinclusive\fP) or not (\fBexclusive\fP). The default is \fBexclusive\fP, which works well with any cursor shape. For vi mode, and particularly for the \fBblock\fP or \fBunderscore\fP cursor shapes you may prefer \fBinclusive\fP\&.
.IP [3] 5
These rely on external tools. Currently xsel, xclip, wl\-copy/wl\-paste and pbcopy/pbpaste are supported.
.SS Multiline editing
.sp
The fish commandline editor can be used to work on commands that are several lines long. There are three ways to make a command span more than a single line:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Pressing the \fBenter\fP key while a block of commands is unclosed, such as when one or more block commands such as \fBfor\fP, \fBbegin\fP or \fBif\fP do not have a corresponding end \%<> command.
.IP \(bu 2
Pressing \fBalt\fP\-\fBenter\fP instead of pressing the \fBenter\fP key.
.IP \(bu 2
By inserting a backslash (\fB\e\fP) character before pressing the \fBenter\fP key, escaping the newline.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The fish commandline editor works exactly the same in single line mode and in multiline mode. To move between lines use the left and right arrow keys and other such keyboard shortcuts.
.SS Searchable command history
.sp
After a command has been executed, it is remembered in the history list. Any duplicate history items are automatically removed. By pressing the up and down keys, you can search forwards and backwards in the history. If the current command line is not empty when starting a history search, only the commands containing the string entered into the command line are shown.
.sp
By pressing \fBalt\fP\-\fBup\fP (\fB↑\fP) and \fBalt\fP\-\fBdown\fP (\fB↓\fP), a history search is also performed, but instead of searching for a complete commandline, each commandline is broken into separate elements like it would be before execution, and the history is searched for an element matching that under the cursor.
.sp
For more complicated searches, you can press \fBctrl\fP\-\fBr\fP to open a pager that allows you to search the history. It shows a limited number of entries in one page, press \fBctrl\fP\-\fBr\fP [4] again to move to the next page and \fBctrl\fP\-\fBs\fP [5] to move to the previous page. You can change the text to refine your search.
.sp
History searches are case\-insensitive unless the search string contains an uppercase character. You can stop a search to edit your search string by pressing \fBescape\fP or \fBpagedown\fP\&.
.sp
Prefixing the commandline with a space will prevent the entire line from being stored in the history. It will still be available for recall until the next command is executed, but will not be stored on disk. This is to allow you to fix misspellings and such.
.sp
The command history is stored in the file \fB~/.local/share/fish/fish_history\fP (or
\fB$XDG_DATA_HOME/fish/fish_history\fP if that variable is set) by default. However, you can set the
\fBfish_history\fP environment variable to change the name of the history session (resulting in a
\fB<session>_history\fP file); both before starting the shell and while the shell is running.
.sp
See the history \%<> command for other manipulations.
.sp
Examples:
.sp
To search for previous entries containing the word \(aqmake\(aq, type \fBmake\fP in the console and press the up key.
.sp
If the commandline reads \fBcd m\fP, place the cursor over the \fBm\fP character and press \fBalt\fP\-\fBup\fP (\fB↑\fP) to search for previously typed words containing \(aqm\(aq.
.IP [4] 5
Or another binding that triggers the \fBhistory\-pager\fP input function. See bind \%<> for a list.
.IP [5] 5
Or another binding that triggers the \fBpager\-toggle\-search\fP input function.
.SS Private mode
.sp
Fish has a private mode, in which command history will not be written to the history file on disk. To enable it, either set \fB$fish_private_mode\fP to a non\-empty value, or launch with \fBfish \-\-private\fP (or \fBfish \-P\fP for short).
.sp
If you launch fish with \fB\-P\fP, it both hides old history and prevents writing history to disk. This is useful to avoid leaking personal information (e.g. for screencasts) or when dealing with sensitive information.
.sp
You can query the variable \fBfish_private_mode\fP (\fBif test \-n \(dq$fish_private_mode\(dq ...\fP) if you would like to respect the user\(aqs wish for privacy and alter the behavior of your own fish scripts.
.SS Navigating directories
.sp
Navigating directories is usually done with the cd \%<> command, but fish offers some advanced features as well.
.sp
The current working directory can be displayed with the pwd \%<> command, or the \fB$PWD\fP special variable \%<#\:variables-special>\&. Usually your prompt already does this.
.SS Directory history
.sp
Fish automatically keeps a trail of the recent visited directories with cd \%<> by storing this history in the \fBdirprev\fP and \fBdirnext\fP variables.
.sp
Several commands are provided to interact with this directory history:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
dirh \%<> prints the history
.IP \(bu 2
cdh \%<> displays a prompt to quickly navigate the history
.IP \(bu 2
prevd \%<> moves backward through the history. It is bound to \fBalt\fP\-\fBleft\fP (\fB←\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
nextd \%<> moves forward through the history. It is bound to \fBalt\fP\-\fBright\fP (\fB→\fP)
.UNINDENT
.SS Directory stack
.sp
Another set of commands, usually also available in other shells like bash, deal with the directory stack. Stack handling is not automatic and needs explicit calls of the following commands:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
dirs \%<> prints the stack
.IP \(bu 2
pushd \%<> adds a directory on top of the stack and makes it the current working directory
.IP \(bu 2
popd \%<> removes the directory on top of the stack and changes the current working directory
.UNINDENT
.SS The fish language
.sp
This document is a comprehensive overview of fish\(aqs scripting language.
.sp
For interactive features see Interactive use \%<>\&.
.SS Syntax overview
.sp
Shells like fish are used by giving them commands. A command is executed by writing the name of the command followed by any arguments. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
echo hello world
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
echo \%<> command writes its arguments to the screen. In this example the output is \fBhello world\fP\&.
.sp
Everything in fish is done with commands. There are commands for repeating other commands, commands for assigning variables, commands for treating a group of commands as a single command, etc. All of these commands follow the same basic syntax.
.sp
Every program on your computer can be used as a command in fish. If the program file is located in one of the \fBPATH\fP directories, you can just type the name of the program to use it. Otherwise the whole filename, including the directory (like \fB/home/me/code/checkers/checkers\fP or \fB\&../checkers\fP) is required.
.sp
Here is a list of some useful commands:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
cd \%<>: Change the current directory
.IP \(bu 2
\fBls\fP: List files and directories
.IP \(bu 2
\fBman\fP: Display a manual page \- try \fBman ls\fP to get help on your \(dqls\(dq command, or \fBman mv\fP to get information about \(dqmv\(dq.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmv\fP: Move (rename) files
.IP \(bu 2
\fBcp\fP: Copy files
.IP \(bu 2
open \%<>: Open files with the default application associated with each filetype
.IP \(bu 2
\fBless\fP: Display the contents of files
.UNINDENT
.sp
Commands and arguments are separated by the space character \fB\(aq \(aq\fP\&. Every command ends with either a newline (by pressing the return key) or a semicolon \fB;\fP\&. Multiple commands can be written on the same line by separating them with semicolons.
.sp
A switch is a very common special type of argument. Switches almost always start with one or more hyphens \fB\-\fP and alter the way a command operates. For example, the \fBls\fP command usually lists the names of all files and directories in the current working directory. By using the \fB\-l\fP switch, the behavior of \fBls\fP is changed to not only display the filename, but also the size, permissions, owner, and modification time of each file.
.sp
Switches differ between commands and are usually documented on a command\(aqs manual page. There are some switches, however, that are common to most commands. For example, \fB\-\-help\fP will usually display a help text, \fB\-\-version\fP will usually display the command version, and \fB\-i\fP will often turn on interactive prompting before taking action. Try \fBman your\-command\-here\fP to get information on your command\(aqs switches.
.sp
So the basic idea of fish is the same as with other unix shells: It gets a commandline, runs expansions, and the result is then run as a command.
.SS Terminology
.sp
Here we define some of the terms used on this page and throughout the rest of the fish documentation:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBArgument\fP: A parameter given to a command. In \fBecho foo\fP, the \(dqfoo\(dq is an argument.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBBuiltin\fP: A command that is implemented by the shell. Builtins are so closely tied to the operation of the shell that it is impossible to implement them as external commands. In \fBecho foo\fP, the \(dqecho\(dq is a builtin.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCommand\fP: A program that the shell can run, or more specifically an external program that the shell runs in another process. External commands are provided on your system, as executable files. In \fBecho foo\fP the \(dqecho\(dq is a builtin command, in \fBcommand echo foo\fP the \(dqecho\(dq is an external command, provided by a file like /bin/echo.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBFunction\fP: A block of commands that can be called as if they were a single command. By using functions, it is possible to string together multiple simple commands into one more advanced command.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBJob\fP: A running pipeline or command.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBPipeline\fP: A set of commands strung together so that the output of one command is the input of the next command. \fBecho foo | grep foo\fP is a pipeline.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBRedirection\fP: An operation that changes one of the input or output streams associated with a job.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBSwitch\fP or \fBOption\fP: A special kind of argument that alters the behavior of a command. A switch almost always begins with one or two hyphens. In \fBecho \-n foo\fP the \(dq\-n\(dq is an option.
.UNINDENT
.SS Quotes
.sp
Sometimes you want to give a command an argument that contains characters special to fish, like spaces or \fB$\fP or \fB*\fP\&. To do that, you can use quotes:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
rm \(dqmy file.txt\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
to remove a file called \fBmy file.txt\fP instead of trying to remove two files, \fBmy\fP and \fBfile.txt\fP\&.
.sp
Fish understands two kinds of quotes: Single (\fB\(aq\fP) and double (\fB\(dq\fP), and both work slightly differently.
.sp
Between single quotes, fish performs no expansions. Between double quotes, fish only performs variable expansion and command substitution in the \fB$(command)\fP\&. No other kind of expansion (including brace expansion or parameter expansion) is performed, and escape sequences (for example, \fB\en\fP) are ignored. Within quotes, whitespace is not used to separate arguments, allowing quoted arguments to contain spaces.
.sp
The only meaningful escape sequences in single quotes are \fB\e\(aq\fP, which escapes a single quote and \fB\e\e\fP, which escapes the backslash symbol. The only meaningful escapes in double quotes are \fB\e\(dq\fP, which escapes a double quote, \fB\e$\fP, which escapes a dollar character, \fB\e\fP followed by a newline, which deletes the backslash and the newline, and \fB\e\e\fP, which escapes the backslash symbol.
.sp
Single quotes have no special meaning within double quotes and vice versa.
.sp
More examples:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
grep \(aqenabled)$\(aq foo.txt
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
searches for lines ending in \fBenabled)\fP in \fBfoo.txt\fP (the \fB$\fP is special to \fBgrep\fP: it matches the end of the line).
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
apt install \(dqpostgres\-*\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
installs all packages with a name starting with \(dqpostgres\-\(dq, instead of looking through the current directory for files named \(dqpostgres\-something\(dq.
.SS Escaping Characters
.sp
Some characters cannot be written directly on the command line. For these characters, so\-called escape sequences are provided. These are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\ea\fP represents the alert character.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\ee\fP represents the escape character.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\ef\fP represents the form feed character.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\en\fP represents a newline character.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\er\fP represents the carriage return character.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\et\fP represents the tab character.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\ev\fP represents the vertical tab character.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\exHH\fP or \fB\eXHH\fP, where \fBHH\fP is a hexadecimal number, represents a byte of data with the specified value. For example, \fB\ex9\fP is the tab character. If you are using a multibyte encoding, this can be used to enter invalid strings. Typically fish is run with the ASCII or UTF\-8 encoding, so anything up to \fB\eX7f\fP is an ASCII character.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\eooo\fP, where \fBooo\fP is an octal number, represents the ASCII character with the specified value. For example, \fB\e011\fP is the tab character. The highest allowed value is \fB\e177\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\euXXXX\fP, where \fBXXXX\fP is a hexadecimal number, represents the 16\-bit Unicode character with the specified value. For example, \fB\eu9\fP is the tab character.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\eUXXXXXXXX\fP, where \fBXXXXXXXX\fP is a hexadecimal number, represents the 32\-bit Unicode character with the specified value. For example, \fB\eU9\fP is the tab character. The highest allowed value is U10FFFF.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\ecX\fP, where \fBX\fP is a letter of the alphabet, represents the control sequence generated by pressing the control key and the specified letter. For example, \fB\eci\fP is the tab character
.UNINDENT
.sp
Some characters have special meaning to the shell. For example, an apostrophe \fB\(aq\fP disables expansion (see Quotes). To tell the shell to treat these characters literally, escape them with a backslash. For example, the command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
echo \e\(aqhello world\e\(aq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
outputs \fB\(aqhello world\(aq\fP (including the apostrophes), while the command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
echo \(aqhello world\(aq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
outputs \fBhello world\fP (without the apostrophes). In the former case the shell treats the apostrophes as literal \fB\(aq\fP characters, while in the latter case it treats them as special expansion modifiers.
.sp
The special characters and their escape sequences are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\e\ \fP (backslash space) escapes the space character. This keeps the shell from splitting arguments on the escaped space.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\e$\fP escapes the dollar character.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\e\e\fP escapes the backslash character.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\e*\fP escapes the star character.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\e?\fP escapes the question mark character (this is not necessary if the \fBqmark\-noglob\fP feature flag is enabled).
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\e~\fP escapes the tilde character.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\e#\fP escapes the hash character.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\e(\fP escapes the left parenthesis character.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\e)\fP escapes the right parenthesis character.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\e{\fP escapes the left curly bracket character.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\e}\fP escapes the right curly bracket character.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\e[\fP escapes the left bracket character.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\e]\fP escapes the right bracket character.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\e<\fP escapes the less than character.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\e>\fP escapes the more than character.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\e&\fP escapes the ampersand character.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\e|\fP escapes the vertical bar character.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\e;\fP escapes the semicolon character.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\e\(dq\fP escapes the quote character.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\e\(aq\fP escapes the apostrophe character.
.UNINDENT
.sp
As a special case, \fB\e\fP immediately followed by a literal new line is a \(dqcontinuation\(dq and tells fish to ignore the line break and resume input at the start of the next line (without introducing any whitespace or terminating a token).
.SS Input/Output Redirection
.sp
Most programs use three input/output (I/O) streams:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Standard input (stdin) for reading. Defaults to reading from the keyboard.
.IP \(bu 2
Standard output (stdout) for writing output. Defaults to writing to the screen.
.IP \(bu 2
Standard error (stderr) for writing errors and warnings. Defaults to writing to the screen.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Each stream has a number called the file descriptor (FD): 0 for stdin, 1 for stdout, and 2 for stderr.
.sp
The destination of a stream can be changed using something called \fIredirection\fP\&. For example, \fBecho hello > output.txt\fP, redirects the standard output of the \fBecho\fP command to a text file.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
To read standard input from a file, use \fB<SOURCE_FILE\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
To read standard input from a file or /dev/null if it can\(aqt be read, use \fB<?SOURCE_FILE\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
To write standard output to a file, use \fB>DESTINATION\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
To write standard error to a file, use \fB2>DESTINATION\fP\&. [1]
.IP \(bu 2
To append standard output to a file, use \fB>>DESTINATION_FILE\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
To append standard error to a file, use \fB2>>DESTINATION_FILE\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
To not overwrite (\(dqclobber\(dq) an existing file, use \fB>?DESTINATION\fP or \fB2>?DESTINATION\fP\&. This is known as the \(dqnoclobber\(dq redirection.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBDESTINATION\fP can be one of the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A filename to write the output to. Often \fB>/dev/null\fP to silence output by writing it to the special \(dqsinkhole\(dq file.
.IP \(bu 2
An ampersand (\fB&\fP) followed by the number of another file descriptor like \fB&2\fP for standard error. The output will be written to the destination descriptor.
.IP \(bu 2
An ampersand followed by a minus sign (\fB&\-\fP). The file descriptor will be closed. Note: This may cause the program to fail because its writes will be unsuccessful.
.UNINDENT
.sp
As a convenience, the redirection \fB&>\fP can be used to direct both stdout and stderr to the same destination. For example, \fBecho hello &> all_output.txt\fP redirects both stdout and stderr to the file \fBall_output.txt\fP\&. This is equivalent to \fBecho hello > all_output.txt 2>&1\fP\&.  You can also use \fB&>>\fP to append both stdout and stderr to the same destination.
.sp
Any arbitrary file descriptor can be used in a redirection by prefixing the redirection with the FD number.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
To redirect the input of descriptor N, use \fBN<DESTINATION\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
To redirect the output of descriptor N, use \fBN>DESTINATION\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
To append the output of descriptor N to a file, use \fBN>>DESTINATION_FILE\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
File descriptors cannot be used with a \fB<?\fP input redirection, only a regular \fB<\fP one.
.sp
For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# Write \(gafoo\(ga\(aqs standard error (file descriptor 2)
# to a file called \(dqoutput.stderr\(dq:
foo 2> output.stderr

# if $num doesn\(aqt contain a number,
# this test will be false and print an error,
# so by ignoring the error we can be sure that we\(aqre dealing
# with a number in the \(dqif\(dq block:
if test \(dq$num\(dq \-gt 2 2>/dev/null
    # do things with $num as a number greater than 2
else
    # do things if $num is <= 2 or not a number
end

# Save \(gamake\(gas output in a file:
make &>/log

# Redirections stack and can be used with blocks:
begin
    echo stdout
    echo stderr >&2 # <\- this goes to stderr!
end >/dev/null # ignore stdout, so this prints \(dqstderr\(dq

# print all lines that include \(dqfoo\(dq from myfile, or nothing if it doesn\(aqt exist.
string match \(aq*foo*\(aq <?myfile
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
It is an error to redirect a builtin, function, or block to a file descriptor above 2. However this is supported for external commands.
.IP [1] 5
Previous versions of fish also allowed specifying this as \fB^DESTINATION\fP, but that made another character special so it was deprecated and removed. See feature flags\&.
.SS Piping
.sp
Another way to redirect streams is a \fIpipe\fP\&. A pipe connects streams with each other. Usually the standard output of one command is connected with the standard input of another. This is done by separating commands with the pipe character \fB|\fP\&. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
cat foo.txt | head
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The command \fBcat foo.txt\fP sends the contents of \fBfoo.txt\fP to stdout. This output is provided as input for the \fBhead\fP program, which prints the first 10 lines of its input.
.sp
It is possible to pipe a different output file descriptor by prepending its FD number and the output redirect symbol to the pipe. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
make fish 2>| less
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
will attempt to build \fBfish\fP, and any errors will be shown using the \fBless\fP pager. [2]
.sp
As a convenience, the pipe \fB&|\fP redirects both stdout and stderr to the same process. This is different from bash, which uses \fB|&\fP\&.
.IP [2] 5
A \(dqpager\(dq here is a program that takes output and \(dqpaginates\(dq it. \fBless\fP doesn\(aqt just do pages, it allows arbitrary scrolling (even back!).
.SS Combining pipes and redirections
.sp
It is possible to use multiple redirections and a pipe at the same time. In that case, they are read in this order:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
First the pipe is set up.
.IP 2. 3
Then the redirections are evaluated from left\-to\-right.
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is important when any redirections reference other file descriptors with the \fB&N\fP syntax. When you say \fB>&2\fP, that will redirect stdout to where stderr is pointing to \fIat that time\fP\&.
.sp
Consider this helper function:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# Make a function that prints something to stdout and stderr
function print
    echo out
    echo err >&2
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now let\(aqs see a few cases:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# Redirect both stderr and stdout to less
print 2>&1 | less
# or
print &| less

# Show the \(dqout\(dq on stderr, silence the \(dqerr\(dq
print >&2 2>/dev/null

# Silence both
print >/dev/null 2>&1
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Job control
.sp
When you start a job in fish, fish itself will pause, and give control of the terminal to the program it just started. Sometimes, you want to continue using the commandline, and have the job run in the background. To create a background job, append an \fB&\fP (ampersand) to your command. This will tell fish to run the job in the background. Background jobs are very useful when running programs that have a graphical user interface.
.sp
Example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
emacs &
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
will start the emacs text editor in the background. fg \%<> can be used to bring it into the foreground again when needed.
.sp
Most programs allow you to suspend the program\(aqs execution and return control to fish by pressing \fBctrl\fP\-\fBz\fP (also referred to as \fB^Z\fP). Once back at the fish commandline, you can start other programs and do anything you want. If you then want you can go back to the suspended command by using the fg \%<> (foreground) command.
.sp
If you instead want to put a suspended job into the background, use the bg \%<> command.
.sp
To get a listing of all currently started jobs, use the jobs \%<> command.
These listed jobs can be removed with the disown \%<> command.
.sp
At the moment, functions cannot be started in the background. Functions that are stopped and then restarted in the background using the bg \%<> command will not execute correctly.
.sp
If the \fB&\fP character is followed by a non\-separating character, it is not interpreted as background operator. Separating characters are whitespace and the characters \fB;<>&|\fP\&.
.SS Functions
.sp
Functions are programs written in the fish syntax. They group together various commands and their arguments using a single name.
.sp
For example, here\(aqs a simple function to list directories:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
function ll
    ls \-l $argv
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The first line tells fish to define a function by the name of \fBll\fP, so it can be used by writing \fBll\fP on the commandline. The second line tells fish that the command \fBls \-l $argv\fP should be called when \fBll\fP is invoked. $argv is a list variable, which always contains all arguments sent to the function. In the example above, these are passed on to the \fBls\fP command. The \fBend\fP on the third line ends the definition.
.sp
Calling this as \fBll /tmp/\fP will end up running \fBls \-l /tmp/\fP, which will list the contents of /tmp.
.sp
This is a kind of function known as an alias\&.
.sp
Fish\(aqs prompt is also defined in a function, called fish_prompt \%<>\&. It is run when the prompt is about to be displayed and its output forms the prompt:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
function fish_prompt
    # A simple prompt. Displays the current directory
    # (which fish stores in the $PWD variable)
    # and then a user symbol \- a \(aq►\(aq for a normal user and a \(aq#\(aq for root.
    set \-l user_char \(aq►\(aq
    if fish_is_root_user
        set user_char \(aq#\(aq
    end

    echo (set_color yellow)$PWD (set_color purple)$user_char
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To edit a function, you can use funced \%<>, and to save a function funcsave \%<>\&. This will store it in a function file that fish will autoload when needed.
.sp
The functions \%<> builtin can show a function\(aqs current definition (and type \%<> will also do if given a function).
.sp
For more information on functions, see the documentation for the function \%<> builtin.
.SS Defining aliases
.sp
One of the most common uses for functions is to slightly alter the behavior of an already existing command. For example, one might want to redefine the \fBls\fP command to display colors. The switch for turning on colors on GNU systems is \fB\-\-color=auto\fP\&. An alias around \fBls\fP might look like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
function ls
    command ls \-\-color=auto $argv
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
There are a few important things that need to be noted about aliases:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Always take care to add the $argv variable to the list of parameters to the wrapped command. This makes sure that if the user specifies any additional parameters to the function, they are passed on to the underlying command.
.IP \(bu 2
If the alias has the same name as the aliased command, you need to prefix the call to the program with \fBcommand\fP to tell fish that the function should not call itself, but rather a command with the same name. If you forget to do so, the function would call itself until the end of time. Usually fish is smart enough to figure this out and will refrain from doing so (which is hopefully in your interest).
.UNINDENT
.sp
To easily create a function of this form, you can use the alias \%<> command. Unlike other shells, this just makes functions \- fish has no separate concept of an \(dqalias\(dq, we just use the word for a simple wrapping function like this. alias \%<> immediately creates a function. Consider using \fBalias \-\-save\fP or funcsave \%<> to save the created function into an autoload file instead of recreating the alias each time.
.sp
For an alternative, try abbreviations \%<#\:abbreviations>\&. These are words that are expanded while you type, instead of being actual functions inside the shell.
.SS Autoloading functions
.sp
Functions can be defined on the commandline or in a configuration file, but they can also be automatically loaded. This has some advantages:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
An autoloaded function becomes available automatically to all running shells.
.IP \(bu 2
If the function definition is changed, all running shells will automatically reload the altered version, after a while.
.IP \(bu 2
Startup time and memory usage is improved, etc.
.UNINDENT
.sp
When fish needs to load a function, it searches through any directories in the list variable \fB$fish_function_path\fP for a file with a name consisting of the name of the function plus the suffix \fB\&.fish\fP and loads the first it finds.
.sp
For example if you try to execute something called \fBbanana\fP, fish will go through all directories in $fish_function_path looking for a file called \fBbanana.fish\fP and load the first one it finds.
.sp
By default \fB$fish_function_path\fP contains the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A directory for users to keep their own functions, usually \fB~/.config/fish/functions\fP (controlled by the \fBXDG_CONFIG_HOME\fP environment variable).
.IP \(bu 2
A directory for functions for all users on the system, usually \fB/etc/fish/functions\fP (really \fB$__fish_sysconfdir/functions\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Directories for other software to put their own functions. These are in the directories under \fB$__fish_user_data_dir\fP (usually \fB~/.local/share/fish\fP, controlled by the \fBXDG_DATA_HOME\fP environment variable) and in the \fBXDG_DATA_DIRS\fP environment variable, in a subdirectory called \fBfish/vendor_functions.d\fP\&. The default value for \fBXDG_DATA_DIRS\fP is usually \fB/usr/share/fish/vendor_functions.d\fP and \fB/usr/local/share/fish/vendor_functions.d\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you are unsure, your functions probably belong in \fB~/.config/fish/functions\fP\&.
.sp
As we\(aqve explained, autoload files are loaded \fIby name\fP, so, while you can put multiple functions into one file, the file will only be loaded automatically once you try to execute the one that shares the name.
.sp
Autoloading also won\(aqt work for event handlers, since fish cannot know that a function is supposed to be executed when an event occurs when it hasn\(aqt yet loaded the function. See the event handlers section for more information.
.sp
If a file of the right name doesn\(aqt define the function, fish will not read other autoload files, instead it will go on to try builtins and finally commands. This allows masking a function defined later in $fish_function_path, e.g. if your administrator has put something into /etc/fish/functions that you want to skip.
.sp
If you are developing another program and want to install fish functions for it, install them to the \(dqvendor\(dq functions directory. As this path varies from system to system, you can use \fBpkgconfig\fP to discover it with the output of \fBpkg\-config \-\-variable functionsdir fish\fP\&. Your installation system should support a custom path to override the pkgconfig path, as other distributors may need to alter it easily.
.SS Comments
.sp
Anything after a \fB#\fP until the end of the line is a comment. That means it\(aqs purely for the reader\(aqs benefit, fish ignores it.
.sp
This is useful to explain what and why you are doing something:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
function ls
    # The function is called ls,
    # so we have to explicitly call \(gacommand ls\(ga to avoid calling ourselves.
    command ls \-\-color=auto $argv
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
There are no multiline comments. If you want to make a comment span multiple lines, start each line with a \fB#\fP\&.
.sp
Comments can also appear after a line like so:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set \-gx EDITOR emacs # I don\(aqt like vim.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Conditions
.sp
Fish has some builtins that let you execute commands only if a specific criterion is met: if \%<>, switch \%<>, and \%<> and or \%<>, and also the familiar &&/|| syntax.
.SS The \fBif\fP statement
.sp
The if \%<> statement runs a block of commands if the condition was true.
.sp
Like other shells, but unlike typical programming languages you might know, the condition here is a \fIcommand\fP\&. Fish runs it, and if it returns a true exit status (that\(aqs 0), the if\-block is run. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
if test \-e /etc/os\-release
    cat /etc/os\-release
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This uses the test \%<> command to see if the file /etc/os\-release exists. If it does, it runs \fBcat\fP, which prints it on the screen.
.sp
Unlike other shells, the condition command ends after the first job, there is no \fBthen\fP here. Combiners like \fBand\fP and \fBor\fP extend the condition.
.sp
A more complicated example with a command substitution:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
if test \(dq$(uname)\(dq = Linux
    echo I like penguins
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Because \fBtest\fP can be used for many different tests, it is important to quote variables and command substitutions. If the \fB$(uname)\fP was not quoted, and \fBuname\fP printed nothing it would run \fBtest = Linux\fP, which is an error.
.sp
\fBif\fP can also take \fBelse if\fP clauses with additional conditions and an  else \%<> clause that is executed when everything else was false:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
if test \(dq$number\(dq \-gt 10
   echo Your number was greater than 10
else if test \(dq$number\(dq \-gt 5
   echo Your number was greater than 5
else if test \(dq$number\(dq \-gt 1
   echo Your number was greater than 1
else
   echo Your number was smaller or equal to 1
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The not \%<> keyword can be used to invert the status:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# Check if the file contains the string \(dqfish\(dq anywhere.
# This executes the \(gagrep\(ga command, which searches for a string,
# and if it finds it returns a status of 0.
# The \(ganot\(ga then turns 0 into 1 or anything else into 0.
# The \(ga\-q\(ga switch stops it from printing any matches.

Other things commonly used in if\-conditions:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
contains \%<> \- to see if a list contains a specific element (\fBif contains \-\- /usr/bin $PATH\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
string \%<> \- to e.g. match strings (\fBif string match \-q \-\- \(aq*\-\(aq $arg\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
path \%<> \- to check if paths of some criteria exist (\fBif path is \-rf \-\- ~/.config/fish/config.fish\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
type \%<> \- to see if a command, function or builtin exists (\fBif type \-q git\fP)
.UNINDENT
.SS The \fBswitch\fP statement
.sp
The switch \%<> command is used to execute one of possibly many blocks of commands depending on the value of a string. It can take multiple case \%<> blocks that are executed when the string matches. They can take wildcards\&. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
switch (uname)
case Linux
    echo Hi Tux!
case Darwin
    echo Hi Hexley!
case DragonFly \(aq*BSD\(aq
    echo Hi Beastie! # this also works for FreeBSD and NetBSD
case \(aq*\(aq
    echo Hi, stranger!
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Unlike other shells or programming languages, there is no fallthrough \- the first matching \fBcase\fP block is executed and then control jumps out of the \fBswitch\fP\&.
.SS Combiners (\fBand\fP / \fBor\fP / \fB&&\fP / \fB||\fP)
.sp
For simple checks, you can use combiners. and \%<> or \fB&&\fP run the second command if the first succeeded, while or \%<> or \fB||\fP run it if the first failed. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is a standard place to store configuration.
# If it\(aqs not set applications should use ~/.config.
set \-q XDG_CONFIG_HOME; and set \-l configdir $XDG_CONFIG_HOME
or set \-l configdir ~/.config
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that combiners are \fIlazy\fP \- only the part that is necessary to determine the final status is run.
.sp
Compare:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
if sleep 2; and false
    echo \(aqHow did I get here? This should be impossible\(aq
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
and:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
if false; and sleep 2
    echo \(aqHow did I get here? This should be impossible\(aq
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
These do essentially the same thing, but the former takes 2 seconds longer because the \fBsleep\fP always needs to run.
.sp
Or you can have a case where it is necessary to stop early:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
if command \-sq foo; and foo
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If this went on after seeing that the command \(dqfoo\(dq doesn\(aqt exist, it would try to run \fBfoo\fP and error because it wasn\(aqt found!
.sp
Combiners execute step\-by\-step, so it isn\(aqt recommended to build longer chains of them because they might do something you don\(aqt want. Consider:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
test \-e /etc/my.config
or echo \(dqOH NO WE NEED A CONFIG FILE\(dq
and return 1
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will execute \fBreturn 1\fP also if the \fBtest\fP succeeded. This is because fish runs \fBtest \-e /etc/my.config\fP, sets $status to 0, then skips the \fBecho\fP, keeps $status at 0, and then executes the \fBreturn 1\fP because $status is still 0.
.sp
So if you have more complex conditions or want to run multiple things after something failed, consider using an if\&. Here that would be:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
if not test \-e /etc/my.config
    echo \(dqOH NO WE NEED A CONFIG FILE\(dq
    return 1
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Loops and blocks
.sp
Like most programming language, fish also has the familiar while \%<> and for \%<> loops.
.sp
\fBwhile\fP works like a repeated if:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
while true
    echo Still running
    sleep 1
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
will print \(dqStill running\(dq once a second. You can abort it with ctrl\-c.
.sp
\fBfor\fP loops work like in other shells, which is more like python\(aqs for\-loops than e.g. C\(aqs:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
for file in *
    echo file: $file
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
will print each file in the current directory. The part after the \fBin\fP is a list of arguments, so you can use any expansions there:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set moreanimals bird fox
for animal in {cat,}fish dog $moreanimals
   echo I like the $animal
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you need a list of numbers, you can use the \fBseq\fP command to create one:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
for i in (seq 1 5)
    echo $i
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
break \%<> is available to break out of a loop, and continue \%<> to jump to the next iteration.
.sp
Input and output redirections (including pipes) can also be applied to loops:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
while read \-l line
    echo line: $line
end < file
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In addition there\(aqs a begin \%<> block that just groups commands together so you can redirect to a block or use a new variable scope without any repetition:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
begin
   set \-l foo bar # this variable will only be available in this block!
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Parameter expansion
.sp
When fish is given a commandline, it expands the parameters before sending them to the command. There are multiple different kinds of expansions:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Wildcards, to create filenames from patterns \- \fB*.jpg\fP
.IP \(bu 2
Variable expansion, to use the value of a variable \- \fB$HOME\fP
.IP \(bu 2
Command substitution, to use the output of another command \- \fB$(cat /path/to/file)\fP
.IP \(bu 2
Brace expansion, to write lists with common pre\- or suffixes in a shorter way \fB{/usr,}/bin\fP
.IP \(bu 2
Tilde expansion, to turn the \fB~\fP at the beginning of paths into the path to the home directory \fB~/bin\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
Parameter expansion is limited to 524288 items. There is a limit to how many arguments the operating system allows for any command, and 524288 is far above it. This is a measure to stop the shell from hanging doing useless computation.
.SS Wildcards (\(dqGlobbing\(dq)
.sp
When a parameter includes an unquoted \fB*\fP star (or \(dqasterisk\(dq) or a \fB?\fP question mark, fish uses it as a wildcard to match files.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB*\fP matches any number of characters (including zero) in a file name, not including \fB/\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB**\fP matches any number of characters (including zero), and also descends into subdirectories. If \fB**\fP is a segment by itself, that segment may match zero times, for compatibility with other shells.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB?\fP can match any single character except \fB/\fP\&. This is deprecated and can be disabled via the \fBqmark\-noglob\fP feature flag, so \fB?\fP will be an ordinary character.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Wildcard matches are sorted case insensitively. When sorting matches containing numbers, they are naturally sorted, so that the strings \(aq1\(aq \(aq5\(aq and \(aq12\(aq would be sorted like 1, 5, 12.
.sp
Hidden files (where the name begins with a dot) are not considered when wildcarding unless the wildcard string has a dot in that place.
.sp
Examples:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBa*\fP matches any files beginning with an \(aqa\(aq in the current directory.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB**\fP matches any files and directories in the current directory and all of its subdirectories.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB~/.*\fP matches all hidden files (also known as \(dqdotfiles\(dq) and directories in your home directory.
.UNINDENT
.sp
For most commands, if any wildcard fails to expand, the command is not executed, $status is set to nonzero, and a warning is printed. This behavior is like what bash does with \fBshopt \-s failglob\fP\&. There are exceptions, namely set \%<> and path \%<>, overriding variables in overrides, count \%<> and for \%<>\&. Their globs will instead expand to zero arguments (so the command won\(aqt see them at all), like with \fBshopt \-s nullglob\fP in bash.
.sp
Examples:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# List the .foo files, or warns if there aren\(aqt any.
ls *.foo

# List the .foo files, if any.
set foos *.foo
if count $foos >/dev/null
    ls $foos
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Unlike bash (by default), fish will not pass on the literal glob character if no match was found, so for a command like \fBapt install\fP that does the matching itself, you need to add quotes:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
apt install \(dqncurses\-*\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Variable expansion
.sp
One of the most important expansions in fish is the \(dqvariable expansion\(dq. This is the replacing of a dollar sign (\fB$\fP) followed by a variable name with the _value_ of that variable.
.sp
A simple example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
echo $HOME
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
which will replace \fB$HOME\fP with the home directory of the current user, and pass it to echo \%<>, which will then print it.
.sp
Some variables like \fB$HOME\fP are already set because fish sets them by default or because fish\(aqs parent process passed them to fish when it started it. You can define your own variables by setting them with set \%<>:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set my_directory /home/cooluser/mystuff
ls $my_directory
# shows the contents of /home/cooluser/mystuff
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For more on how setting variables works, see Shell variables and the following sections.
.sp
Sometimes a variable has no value because it is undefined or empty, and it expands to nothing:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
echo $nonexistentvariable
# Prints no output.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To separate a variable name from text you can encase the variable within double\-quotes or braces:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set WORD cat
echo The plural of $WORD is \(dq$WORD\(dqs
# Prints \(dqThe plural of cat is cats\(dq because $WORD is set to \(dqcat\(dq.
echo The plural of $WORD is {$WORD}s
# ditto
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Without the quotes or braces, fish will try to expand a variable called \fB$WORDs\fP, which may not exist.
.sp
The latter syntax \fB{$WORD}\fP is a special case of brace expansion\&.
.sp
If $WORD here is undefined or an empty list, the \(dqs\(dq is not printed. However, it is printed if $WORD is the empty string (like after \fBset WORD \(dq\(dq\fP).
.sp
For more on shell variables, read the Shell variables section.
.SS Quoting variables
.sp
Variable expansion also happens in double quoted strings. Inside double quotes (\fB\(dqthese\(dq\fP), variables will always expand to exactly one argument. If they are empty or undefined, it will result in an empty string. If they have one element, they\(aqll expand to that element. If they have more than that, the elements will be joined with spaces, unless the variable is a path variable \- in that case it will use a colon (\fB:\fP) instead [3]\&.
.sp
Fish variables are all lists, and they are split into elements when they are \fIset\fP \- that means it is important to decide whether to use quotes or not with set \%<>:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set foo 1 2 3 # a variable with three elements
rm $foo # runs the equivalent of \(garm 1 2 3\(ga \- trying to delete three files: 1, 2 and 3.
rm \(dq$foo\(dq # runs \(garm \(aq1 2 3\(aq\(ga \- trying to delete one file called \(aq1 2 3\(aq

set foo # an empty variable
rm $foo # runs \(garm\(ga without arguments
rm \(dq$foo\(dq # runs the equivalent of \(garm \(aq\(aq\(ga

set foo \(dq1 2 3\(dq
rm $foo # runs the equivalent of \(garm \(aq1 2 3\(aq\(ga \- trying to delete one file
rm \(dq$foo\(dq # same thing
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is unlike other shells, which do what is known as \(dqWord Splitting\(dq, where they split the variable when it is \fIused\fP in an expansion. E.g. in bash:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
foo=\(dq1 2 3\(dq
rm $foo # runs the equivalent of \(garm 1 2 3\(ga
rm \(dq$foo\(dq # runs the equivalent of \(garm \(aq1 2 3\(aq\(ga
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is the cause of very common problems with filenames with spaces in bash scripts.
.sp
In fish, unquoted variables will expand to as many arguments as they have elements. That means an empty list will expand to nothing, a variable with one element will expand to that element, and a variable with multiple elements will expand to each of those elements separately.
.sp
If a variable expands to nothing, it will cancel out any other strings attached to it. See the Combining Lists section for more information.
.sp
Most of the time, not quoting a variable is correct. The exception is when you need to ensure that the variable is passed as one element, even if it might be unset or have multiple elements. This happens often with test \%<>:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set \-l foo one two three
test \-n $foo
# prints an error that it got too many arguments, because it was executed like
test \-n one two three

test \-n \(dq$foo\(dq
# works, because it was executed like
test \-n \(dqone two three\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP [3] 5
Unlike bash or zsh, which will join with the first character of $IFS (which usually is space).
.SS Dereferencing variables
.sp
The \fB$\fP symbol can also be used multiple times, as a kind of \(dqdereference\(dq operator (the \fB*\fP in C or C++), like in the following code:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set foo a b c
set a 10; set b 20; set c 30
for i in (seq (count $$foo))
    echo $$foo[$i]
end

# Output is:
# 10
# 20
# 30
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB$$foo[$i]\fP is \(dqthe value of the variable named by \fB$foo[$i]\fP\(dq.
.sp
This can also be used to give a variable name to a function:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
function print_var
    for arg in $argv
        echo Variable $arg is $$arg
    end
end

set \-g foo 1 2 3
set \-g bar a b c

print_var foo bar
# prints \(dqVariable foo is 1 2 3\(dq and \(dqVariable bar is a b c\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Of course the variable will have to be accessible from the function, so it needs to be global/universal or exported\&. It also can\(aqt clash with a variable name used inside the function. So if we had made $foo there a local variable, or if we had named it \(dqarg\(dq instead, it would not have worked.
.sp
When using this feature together with slices, the slices will be used from the inside out. \fB$$foo[5]\fP will use the fifth element of \fB$foo\fP as a variable name, instead of giving the fifth element of all the variables $foo refers to. That would instead be expressed as \fB$$foo[1..\-1][5]\fP (take all elements of \fB$foo\fP, use them as variable names, then give the fifth element of those).
.sp
Some more examples:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set listone 1 2 3
set listtwo 4 5 6
set var listone listtwo

echo $$var
# Output is 1 2 3 4 5 6

echo $$var[1]
# Output is 1 2 3

echo $$var[2][3]
# $var[2] is listtwo, third element of that is 6, output is 6

echo $$var[..][2]
# The second element of every variable, so output is 2 5
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Variables as command
.sp
Like other shells, you can run the value of a variable as a command.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> set \-g EDITOR emacs
> $EDITOR foo # opens emacs, possibly the GUI version
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you want to give the command an argument inside the variable it needs to be a separate element:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> set EDITOR emacs \-nw
> $EDITOR foo # opens emacs in the terminal even if the GUI is installed
> set EDITOR \(dqemacs \-nw\(dq
> $EDITOR foo # tries to find a command called \(dqemacs \-nw\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Also like other shells, this only works with commands, builtins and functions \- it will not work with keywords because they have syntactical importance.
.sp
For instance \fBset if $if\fP won\(aqt allow you to make an if\-block, and \fBset cmd command\fP won\(aqt allow you to use the command \%<> decorator, but only uses like \fB$cmd \-q foo\fP\&.
.SS Command substitution
.sp
A \fBcommand substitution\fP is an expansion that uses the \fIoutput\fP of a command as the arguments to another. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
echo $(pwd)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This executes the pwd \%<> command, takes its output (more specifically what it wrote to the standard output \(dqstdout\(dq stream) and uses it as arguments to echo \%<>\&. So the inner command (the \fBpwd\fP) is run first and has to complete before the outer command can even be started.
.sp
If the inner command prints multiple lines, fish will use each separate line as a separate argument to the outer command. Unlike other shells, the value of \fB$IFS\fP is not used [4], fish splits on newlines.
.sp
Command substitutions can also be double\-quoted:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
echo \(dq$(pwd)\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When using double quotes, the command output is not split up by lines, but trailing empty lines are still removed.
.sp
If the output is piped to string split or string split0 \%<> as the last step, those splits are used as they appear instead of splitting lines.
.sp
Fish also allows spelling command substitutions without the dollar, like \fBecho (pwd)\fP\&. This variant will not be expanded in double\-quotes (\fBecho \(dq(pwd)\(dq\fP will print \fB(pwd)\fP).
.sp
The exit status of the last run command substitution is available in the status variable if the substitution happens in the context of a set \%<> command (so \fBif set \-l (something)\fP checks if \fBsomething\fP returned true).
.sp
To use only some lines of the output, refer to slices\&.
.sp
Examples:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# Outputs \(aqimage.png\(aq.
echo (basename image.jpg .jpg).png

# Convert all JPEG files in the current directory to the
# PNG format using the \(aqconvert\(aq program.
for i in *.jpg; convert $i (basename $i .jpg).png; end

# Set the \(ga\(gadata\(ga\(ga variable to the contents of \(aqdata.txt\(aq
# without splitting it into a list.
set data \(dq$(cat data.txt)\(dq

# Set \(ga\(ga$data\(ga\(ga to the contents of data, splitting on NUL\-bytes.
set data (cat data | string split0)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Sometimes you want to pass the output of a command to another command that only accepts files. If it\(aqs just one file, you can usually pass it via a pipe, like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
grep fish myanimallist1 | wc \-l
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
but if you need multiple or the command doesn\(aqt read from standard input, \(dqprocess substitution\(dq is useful. Other shells allow this via \fBfoo <(bar) <(baz)\fP, and fish uses the psub \%<> command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# Compare only the lines containing \(dqfish\(dq in two files:
diff \-u (grep fish myanimallist1 | psub) (grep fish myanimallist2 | psub)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This creates a temporary file, stores the output of the command in that file and prints the filename, so it is given to the outer command.
.sp
Fish has a default limit of 1 GiB on the data it will read in a command substitution. If that limit is reached the command (all of it, not just the command substitution \- the outer command won\(aqt be executed at all) fails and \fB$status\fP is set to 122. This is so command substitutions can\(aqt cause the system to go out of memory, because typically your operating system has a much lower limit, so reading more than that would be useless and harmful. This limit can be adjusted with the \fBfish_read_limit\fP variable (\fI0\fP meaning no limit). This limit also affects the read \%<> command.
.IP [4] 5
One exception: Setting \fB$IFS\fP to empty will disable line splitting. This is deprecated, use string split \%<> instead.
.SS Brace expansion
.sp
Curly braces can be used to write comma\-separated lists. They will be expanded with each element becoming a new parameter, with the surrounding string attached. This is useful to save on typing, and to separate a variable name from surrounding text.
.sp
Examples:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> echo input.{c,h,txt}
input.c input.h input.txt

# Move all files with the suffix \(aq.c\(aq or \(aq.h\(aq to the subdirectory src.
> mv *.{c,h} src/

# Make a copy of \(gafile\(ga at \(gafile.bak\(ga.
> cp file{,.bak}

> set \-l dogs hot cool cute \(dqgood \(dq
> echo {$dogs}dog
hotdog cooldog cutedog good dog
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If there is no \(dq,\(dq or variable expansion between the curly braces, they will not be expanded:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# This {} isn\(aqt special
> echo foo\-{}
foo\-{}
# This passes \(dqHEAD@{2}\(dq to git
> git reset \-\-hard HEAD@{2}
> echo {{a,b}}
{a} {b} # because the inner brace pair is expanded, but the outer isn\(aqt.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If after expansion there is nothing between the braces, the argument will be removed (see the Combining Lists section):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> echo foo\-{$undefinedvar}
# Output is an empty line, like a bare \(gaecho\(ga.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If there is nothing between a brace and a comma or two commas, it\(aqs interpreted as an empty element:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> echo {,,/usr}/bin
/bin /bin /usr/bin
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To use a \(dq,\(dq as an element, quote or escape it.
.sp
The very first character of a command token is never interpreted as expanding brace, because it\(aqs the beginning of a compound statement \%<>:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> {echo hello, && echo world}
hello,
world
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Combining lists
.sp
Fish expands lists like brace expansions:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
>_ set \-l foo x y z
>_ echo 1$foo
# Any element of $foo is combined with the \(dq1\(dq:
1x 1y 1z

>_ echo {good,bad}\(dq apples\(dq
# Any element of the {} is combined with the \(dq apples\(dq:
good apples bad apples

# Or we can mix the two:
>_ echo {good,bad}\(dq \(dq$foo
good x bad x good y bad y good z bad z
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Any string attached to a list will be concatenated to each element.
.sp
Two lists will be expanded in all combinations  \- every element of the first with every element of the second:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
>_ set \-l a x y z; set \-l b 1 2 3
>_ echo $a$b # same as {x,y,z}{1,2,3}
x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 x3 y3 z3
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
A result of this is that, if a list has no elements, this combines the string with no elements, which means the entire token is removed!
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
>_ set \-l c # <\- this list is empty!
>_ echo {$c}word
# Output is an empty line \- the \(dqword\(dq part is gone
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This can be quite useful. For example, if you want to go through all the files in all the directories in \fBPATH\fP, use
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
for file in $PATH/*
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Because \fBPATH\fP is a list, this expands to all the files in all the directories in it. And if there are no directories in \fBPATH\fP, the right answer here is to expand to no files.
.sp
Sometimes this may be unwanted, especially that tokens can disappear after expansion. In those cases, you should double\-quote variables \- \fBecho \(dq$c\(dqword\fP\&.
.sp
This also happens after command substitution\&. To avoid tokens disappearing there, make the inner command return a trailing newline, or double\-quote it:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
>_ set b 1 2 3
>_ echo (echo x)$b
x1 x2 x3
>_ echo (printf \(aq%s\(aq \(aq\(aq)banana
# the printf prints nothing, so this is nothing times \(dqbanana\(dq,
# which is nothing.
>_ echo (printf \(aq%s\en\(aq \(aq\(aq)banana
# the printf prints a newline,
# so the command substitution expands to an empty string,
# so this is \(ga\(aq\(aqbanana\(ga
banana
>_ echo \(dq$(printf \(aq%s\(aq \(aq\(aq)\(dqbanana
# quotes mean this is one argument, the banana stays
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Slices
.sp
Sometimes it\(aqs necessary to access only some of the elements of a list (all fish variables are lists), or some of the lines a command substitution outputs. Both are possible in fish by writing a set of indices in brackets, like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# Make $var a list of four elements
set var one two three four
# Print the second:
echo $var[2]
# prints \(dqtwo\(dq
# or print the first three:
echo $var[1..3]
# prints \(dqone two three\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In index brackets, fish understands ranges written like \fBa..b\fP (\(aqa\(aq and \(aqb\(aq being indices). They are expanded into a sequence of indices from a to b (so \fBa a+1 a+2 ... b\fP), going up if b is larger and going down if a is larger. Negative indices can also be used \- they are taken from the end of the list, so \fB\-1\fP is the last element, and \fB\-2\fP the one before it. If an index doesn\(aqt exist the range is clamped to the next possible index.
.sp
If a list has 5 elements the indices go from 1 to 5, so a range of \fB2..16\fP will only go from element 2 to element 5.
.sp
If the end is negative the range always goes up, so \fB2..\-2\fP will go from element 2 to 4, and \fB2..\-16\fP won\(aqt go anywhere because there is no way to go from the second element to one that doesn\(aqt exist, while going up.
If the start is negative the range always goes down, so \fB\-2..1\fP will go from element 4 to 1, and \fB\-16..2\fP won\(aqt go anywhere because there is no way to go from an element that doesn\(aqt exist to the second element, while going down.
.sp
A missing starting index in a range defaults to 1. This is allowed if the range is the first index expression of the sequence. Similarly, a missing ending index, defaulting to \-1 is allowed for the last index in the sequence.
.sp
Multiple ranges are also possible, separated with a space.
.sp
Some examples:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
echo (seq 10)[1 2 3]
# Prints: 1 2 3

# Limit the command substitution output
echo (seq 10)[2..5]
# Uses elements from 2 to 5
# Output is: 2 3 4 5

echo (seq 10)[7..]
# Prints: 7 8 9 10

# Use overlapping ranges:
echo (seq 10)[2..5 1..3]
# Takes elements from 2 to 5 and then elements from 1 to 3
# Output is: 2 3 4 5 1 2 3

# Reverse output
echo (seq 10)[\-1..1]
# Uses elements from the last output line to
# the first one in reverse direction
# Output is: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

# The command substitution has only one line,
# so these will result in empty output:
echo (echo one)[2..\-1]
echo (echo one)[\-3..1]
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The same works when setting or expanding variables:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# Reverse path variable
set PATH $PATH[\-1..1]
# or
set PATH[\-1..1] $PATH

# Use only n last items of the PATH
set n \-3
echo $PATH[$n..\-1]
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Variables can be used as indices for expansion of variables, like so:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set index 2
set letters a b c d
echo $letters[$index] # returns \(aqb\(aq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
However using variables as indices for command substitution is currently not supported, so:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
echo (seq 5)[$index] # This won\(aqt work

set sequence (seq 5) # It needs to be written on two lines like this.
echo $sequence[$index] # returns \(aq2\(aq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When using indirect variable expansion with multiple \fB$\fP (\fB$$name\fP), you have to give all indices up to the variable you want to slice:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> set \-l list 1 2 3 4 5
> set \-l name list
> echo $$name[1]
1 2 3 4 5
> echo $$name[1..\-1][1..3] # or $$name[1][1..3], since $name only has one element.
1 2 3
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Home directory expansion
.sp
The \fB~\fP (tilde) character at the beginning of a parameter, followed by a username, is expanded into the home directory of the specified user. A lone \fB~\fP, or a \fB~\fP followed by a slash, is expanded into the home directory of the process owner:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
ls ~/Music # lists my music directory

echo ~root # prints root\(aqs home directory, probably \(dq/root\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Combining different expansions
.sp
All of the above expansions can be combined. If several expansions result in more than one parameter, all possible combinations are created.
.sp
When combining multiple parameter expansions, expansions are performed in the following order:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Command substitutions
.IP \(bu 2
Variable expansions
.IP \(bu 2
Bracket expansion
.IP \(bu 2
Wildcard expansion
.UNINDENT
.sp
Expansions are performed from right to left, nested bracket expansions and command substitutions are performed from the inside and out.
.sp
Example:
.sp
If the current directory contains the files \(aqfoo\(aq and \(aqbar\(aq, the command \fBecho a(ls){1,2,3}\fP will output \fBabar1 abar2 abar3 afoo1 afoo2 afoo3\fP\&.

.SS Shell variables
.sp
Variables are a way to save data and pass it around. They can be used just by the shell, or they can be \(dqexported\(dq, so that a copy of the variable is available to any external command the shell starts. An exported variable is referred to as an \(dqenvironment variable\(dq.
.sp
To set a variable value, use the set \%<> command. A variable name can not be empty and can contain only letters, digits, and underscores. It may begin and end with any of those characters.
.sp
Example:
.sp
To set the variable \fBsmurf_color\fP to the value \fBblue\fP, use the command \fBset smurf_color blue\fP\&.
.sp
After a variable has been set, you can use the value of a variable in the shell through variable expansion\&.
.sp
Example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set smurf_color blue
echo Smurfs are usually $smurf_color
set pants_color red
echo Papa smurf, who is $smurf_color, wears $pants_color pants
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
So you set a variable with \fBset\fP, and use it with a \fB$\fP and the name.
.SS Variable Scope
.sp
All variables in fish have a scope. For example they can be global or local to a function or block:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# This variable is global, we can use it everywhere.
set \-\-global name Patrick
# This variable is local, it will not be visible in a function we call from here.
set \-\-local place \(dqat the Krusty Krab\(dq

function local
    # This can find $name, but not $place
    echo Hello this is $name $place

    # This variable is local, it will not be available
    # outside of this function
    set \-\-local instrument mayonnaise
    echo My favorite instrument is $instrument
    # This creates a local $name, and won\(aqt touch the global one
    set \-\-local name Spongebob
    echo My best friend is $name
end

local
# Will print:
# Hello this is Patrick
# My favorite instrument is mayonnaise
# My best friend is Spongebob

echo $name, I am $place and my instrument is $instrument
# Will print:
# Patrick, I am at the Krusty Krab and my instrument is
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
There are four kinds of variable scopes in fish: universal, global, function and local variables.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Universal variables are shared between all fish sessions a user is running on one computer. They are stored on disk and persist even after reboot.
.IP \(bu 2
Global variables are specific to the current fish session. They can be erased by explicitly requesting \fBset \-e\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
Function variables are specific to the currently executing function. They are erased (\(dqgo out of scope\(dq) when the current function ends. Outside of a function, they don\(aqt go out of scope.
.IP \(bu 2
Local variables are specific to the current block of commands, and automatically erased when a specific block goes out of scope. A block of commands is a series of commands that begins with one of the commands \fBfor\fP, \fBwhile\fP , \fBif\fP, \fBfunction\fP, \fBbegin\fP or \fBswitch\fP, and ends with the command \fBend\fP\&. Outside of a block, this is the same as the function scope.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Variables can be explicitly set to be universal with the \fB\-U\fP or \fB\-\-universal\fP switch, global with \fB\-g\fP or \fB\-\-global\fP, function\-scoped with \fB\-f\fP or \fB\-\-function\fP and local to the current block with \fB\-l\fP or \fB\-\-local\fP\&.  The scoping rules when creating or updating a variable are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
When a scope is explicitly given, it will be used. If a variable of the same name exists in a different scope, that variable will not be changed.
.IP \(bu 2
When no scope is given, but a variable of that name exists, the variable of the smallest scope will be modified. The scope will not be changed.
.IP \(bu 2
When no scope is given and no variable of that name exists, the variable is created in function scope if inside a function, or global scope if no function is executing.
.UNINDENT
.sp
There can be many variables with the same name, but different scopes. When you use a variable, the smallest scoped variable of that name will be used. If a local variable exists, it will be used instead of the global or universal variable of the same name.
.sp
Example:
.sp
There are a few possible uses for different scopes.
.sp
Typically inside functions you should use local scope:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
function something
    set \-l file /path/to/my/file
    if not test \-e \(dq$file\(dq
        set file /path/to/my/otherfile
    end
end

# or

function something
    if test \-e /path/to/my/file
        set \-f file /path/to/my/file
    else
        set \-f file /path/to/my/otherfile
    end
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you want to set something in config.fish, or set something in a function and have it available for the rest of the session, global scope is a good choice:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# Don\(aqt shorten the working directory in the prompt
set \-g fish_prompt_pwd_dir_length 0

# Set my preferred cursor style:
function setcursors
   set \-g fish_cursor_default block
   set \-g fish_cursor_insert line
   set \-g fish_cursor_visual underscore
end

# Set my language
set \-gx LANG de_DE.UTF\-8
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you want to set some personal customization, universal variables are nice:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# Typically you\(aqd run this interactively, fish takes care of keeping it.
set \-U fish_color_autosuggestion 555
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Here is an example of local vs function\-scoped variables:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
function test\-scopes
    begin
        # This is a nice local scope where all variables will die
        set \-l pirate \(aqThere be treasure in them thar hills\(aq
        set \-f captain Space, the final frontier
        # If no variable of that name was defined, it is function\-local.
        set gnu \(dqIn the beginning there was nothing, which exploded\(dq
    end

    # This will not output anything, since the pirate was local
    echo $pirate
    # This will output the good Captain\(aqs speech
    # since $captain had function\-scope.
    echo $captain
    # This will output Sir Terry\(aqs wisdom.
    echo $gnu
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When a function calls another, local variables aren\(aqt visible:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
function shiver
    set phrase \(aqShiver me timbers\(aq
end

function avast
    set \-\-local phrase \(aqAvast, mateys\(aq
    # Calling the shiver function here can not
    # change any variables in the local scope
    # so phrase remains as we set it here.
    shiver
    echo $phrase
end
avast

# Outputs \(dqAvast, mateys\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When in doubt, use function\-scoped variables. When you need to make a variable accessible everywhere, make it global. When you need to persistently store configuration, make it universal. When you want to use a variable only in a short block, make it local.
.SS Overriding variables for a single command
.sp
If you want to override a variable for a single command, you can use \(dqvar=val\(dq statements before the command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# Call git status on another directory
# (can also be done via \(gagit \-C somerepo status\(ga)
GIT_DIR=somerepo git status
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Unlike other shells, fish will first set the variable and then perform other expansions on the line, so:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set foo banana
foo=gagaga echo $foo
# prints gagaga, while in other shells it might print \(dqbanana\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Multiple elements can be given in a brace expansion:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# Call bash with a reasonable default path.
PATH={/usr,}/{s,}bin bash
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Or with a glob:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# Run vlc on all mp3 files in the current directory
# If no file exists it will still be run with no arguments
mp3s=*.mp3 vlc $mp3s
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Unlike other shells, this does \fInot\fP inhibit any lookup (aliases or similar). Calling a command after setting a variable override will result in the exact same command being run.
.sp
This syntax is supported since fish 3.1.
.SS Universal Variables
.sp
Universal variables are variables that are shared between all the user\(aqs fish sessions on the computer. Fish stores many of its configuration options as universal variables. This means that in order to change fish settings, all you have to do is change the variable value once, and it will be automatically updated for all sessions, and preserved across computer reboots and login/logout.
.sp
To see universal variables in action, start two fish sessions side by side, and issue the following command in one of them \fBset fish_color_cwd blue\fP\&. Since \fBfish_color_cwd\fP is a universal variable, the color of the current working directory listing in the prompt will instantly change to blue on both terminals.
.sp
Universal variables are stored in the file \fB\&.config/fish/fish_variables\fP\&. Do not edit this file directly, as your edits may be overwritten. Edit the variables through fish scripts or by using fish interactively instead.
.sp
Do not append to universal variables in config.fish, because these variables will then get longer with each new shell instance. Instead, set them once at the command line.
.SS Exporting variables
.sp
Variables in fish can be exported, so they will be inherited by any commands started by fish. In particular, this is necessary for variables used to configure external commands like \fBPAGER\fP or \fBGOPATH\fP, but also for variables that contain general system settings like \fBPATH\fP or \fBLANGUAGE\fP\&. If an external command needs to know a variable, it needs to be exported. Exported variables are also often called \(dqenvironment variables\(dq.
.sp
This also applies to fish \- when it starts up, it receives environment variables from its parent (usually the terminal). These typically include system configuration like \fBPATH\fP and locale variables\&.
.sp
Variables can be explicitly set to be exported with the \fB\-x\fP or \fB\-\-export\fP switch, or not exported with the \fB\-u\fP or \fB\-\-unexport\fP switch.  The exporting rules when setting a variable are similar to the scoping rules for variables \- when an option is passed it is respected, otherwise the variable\(aqs existing state is used. If no option is passed and the variable didn\(aqt exist yet it is not exported.
.sp
As a naming convention, exported variables are in uppercase and unexported variables are in lowercase.
.sp
For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set \-gx ANDROID_HOME ~/.android # /opt/android\-sdk
set \-gx CDPATH . ~ (test \-e ~/Videos; and echo ~/Videos)
set \-gx EDITOR emacs \-nw
set \-gx GOPATH ~/dev/go
set \-gx GTK2_RC_FILES \(dq$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gtk\-2.0/gtkrc\(dq
set \-gx LESSHISTFILE \(dq\-\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note: Exporting is not a scope, but an additional state. It typically makes sense to make exported variables global as well, but local\-exported variables can be useful if you need something more specific than Overrides\&. They are \fIcopied\fP to functions so the function can\(aqt alter them outside, and still available to commands. Global variables are accessible to functions whether they are exported or not.
.SS Lists
.sp
Fish can store a list (or an \(dqarray\(dq if you wish) of multiple strings inside of a variable:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> set mylist first second third
> printf \(aq%s\en\(aq $mylist # prints each element on its own line
first
second
third
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To access one element of a list, use the index of the element inside of square brackets, like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
echo $PATH[3]
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
List indices start at 1 in fish, not 0 like in other languages. This is because it requires less subtracting of 1 and many common Unix tools like \fBseq\fP work better with it (\fBseq 5\fP prints 1 to 5, not 0 to 5). An invalid index is silently ignored resulting in no value (not even an empty string, no argument at all).
.sp
If you don\(aqt use any brackets, all the elements of the list will be passed to the command as separate items. This means you can iterate over a list with \fBfor\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
for i in $PATH
    echo $i is in the path
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This goes over every directory in \fBPATH\fP separately and prints a line saying it is in the path.
.sp
To create a variable \fBsmurf\fP, containing the items \fBblue\fP and \fBsmall\fP, write:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set smurf blue small
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
It is also possible to set or erase individual elements of a list:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# Set smurf to be a list with the elements \(aqblue\(aq and \(aqsmall\(aq
set smurf blue small

# Change the second element of smurf to \(aqevil\(aq
set smurf[2] evil

# Erase the first element
set \-e smurf[1]

# Output \(aqevil\(aq
echo $smurf
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you specify a negative index when expanding or assigning to a list variable, the index will be taken from the \fIend\fP of the list. For example, the index \-1 is the last element of the list:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> set fruit apple orange banana
> echo $fruit[\-1]
banana

> echo $fruit[\-2..\-1]
orange
banana

> echo $fruit[\-1..1] # reverses the list
banana
orange
apple
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
As you see, you can use a range of indices, see slices for details.
.sp
All lists are one\-dimensional and can\(aqt contain other lists, although it is possible to fake nested lists using dereferencing \- see variable expansion\&.
.sp
When a list is exported as an environment variable, it is either space or colon delimited, depending on whether it is a path variable:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> set \-x smurf blue small
> set \-x smurf_PATH forest mushroom
> env | grep smurf
smurf=blue small
smurf_PATH=forest:mushroom
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Fish automatically creates lists from all environment variables whose name ends in \fBPATH\fP (like \fBPATH\fP, \fBCDPATH\fP or \fBMANPATH\fP), by splitting them on colons. Other variables are not automatically split.
.sp
Lists can be inspected with the count \%<> or the contains \%<> commands:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> count $smurf
2

> contains blue $smurf
# blue was found, so it exits with status 0
# (without printing anything)

> echo $status
0

> contains \-i blue $smurf
1
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
A nice thing about lists is that they are passed to commands one element as one argument, so once you\(aqve set your list, you can pass it:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set \-l grep_args \-r \(dqmy string\(dq
grep $grep_args . # will run the same as \(gagrep \-r \(dqmy string\(dq\(ga .
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Unlike other shells, fish does not do \(dqword splitting\(dq \- elements in a list stay as they are, even if they contain spaces or tabs.
.SS Argument Handling
.sp
An important list is \fB$argv\fP, which contains the arguments to a function or script. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
function myfunction
    echo $argv[1]
    echo $argv[3]
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This function takes whatever arguments it gets and prints the first and third:

That covers the positional arguments, but commandline tools often get various options and flags, and $argv would contain them intermingled with the positional arguments. Typical unix argument handling allows short options (\fB\-h\fP, also grouped like in \fBls \-lah\fP), long options (\fB\-\-help\fP) and allows those options to take arguments (\fB\-\-color=auto\fP or \fB\-\-position anywhere\fP or \fBcomplete \-C\(dqgit \(dq\fP) as well as a \fB\-\-\fP separator to signal the end of options. Handling all of these manually is tricky and error\-prone.
.sp
A more robust approach to option handling is argparse \%<>, which checks the defined options and puts them into various variables, leaving only the positional arguments in $argv. Here\(aqs a simple example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
function mybetterfunction
    # We tell argparse about \-h/\-\-help and \-s/\-\-second
    # \- these are short and long forms of the same option.
    # The \(dq\-\-\(dq here is mandatory,
    # it tells it from where to read the arguments.
    argparse h/help s/second \-\- $argv
    # exit if argparse failed because
    # it found an option it didn\(aqt recognize
    # \- it will print an error
    or return

    # If \-h or \-\-help is given, we print a little help text and return
    if set \-ql _flag_help
        echo \(dqmybetterfunction [\-h|\-\-help] [\-s|\-\-second] [ARGUMENT ...]\(dq
        return 0
    end

    # If \-s or \-\-second is given, we print the second argument,
    # not the first and third.
    # (this is also available as _flag_s because of the short version)
    if set \-ql _flag_second
        echo $argv[2]
    else
        echo $argv[1]
        echo $argv[3]
    end

.SS PATH variables
.sp
Path variables are a special kind of variable used to support colon\-delimited path lists including \fBPATH\fP, \fBCDPATH\fP, \fBMANPATH\fP, \fBPYTHONPATH\fP, \fBLANGUAGE\fP (for localization \%<>) etc. All variables that end in \(dqPATH\(dq (case\-sensitive) become PATH variables by default.
.sp
PATH variables act as normal lists, except they are implicitly joined and split on colons.

This is for compatibility with other tools. Unix doesn\(aqt have variables with multiple elements, the closest thing it has are colon\-lists like \fBPATH\fP\&. For obvious reasons this means no element can contain a \fB:\fP\&.

.B fish_escape_delay_ms
sets how long fish waits for another key after seeing an escape, to distinguish pressing the escape key from the start of an escape sequence. The default is 30ms.

.TP
.B fish_sequence_key_delay_ms
sets how long fish waits for another key after seeing a key that is part of a longer sequence, to disambiguate. For instance if you had bound \fB\ecx\ece\fP to open an editor, fish would wait for this long in milliseconds to see a ctrl\-e after a ctrl\-x.

.sp
As a convention, an uppercase name is usually used for exported variables, while lowercase variables are not exported. (\fBCMD_DURATION\fP is an exception for historical reasons). This rule is not enforced by fish, but it is good coding practice to use casing to distinguish between exported and unexported variables.
.sp
Fish also uses some variables internally, their name usually starting with \fB__fish\fP\&. These are internal and should not typically be modified directly.
.SS The status variable
.sp
Whenever a process exits, an exit status is returned to the program that started it (usually the shell). This exit status is an integer number, which tells the calling application how the execution of the command went. In general, a zero exit status means that the command executed without problem, but a non\-zero exit status means there was some form of problem.
.sp
Fish stores the exit status of the last process in the last job to exit in the \fBstatus\fP variable.
.sp
If fish encounters a problem while executing a command, the status variable may also be set to a specific value:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
0 is generally the exit status of commands if they successfully performed the requested operation.
.IP \(bu 2
1 is generally the exit status of commands if they failed to perform the requested operation.
.IP \(bu 2
121 is generally the exit status of commands if they were supplied with invalid arguments.
.IP \(bu 2
123 means that the command was not executed because the command name contained invalid characters.
.IP \(bu 2
124 means that the command was not executed because none of the wildcards in the command produced any matches.
.IP \(bu 2
125 means that while an executable with the specified name was located, the operating system could not actually execute the command.
.IP \(bu 2
126 means that while a file with the specified name was located, it was not executable.
.IP \(bu 2
127 means that no function, builtin or command with the given name could be located.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If a process exits through a signal, the exit status will be 128 plus the number of the signal.
.sp
The status can be negated with not \%<> (or \fB!\fP), which is useful in a condition\&. This turns a status of 0 into 1 and any non\-zero status into 0.
.sp
There is also \fB$pipestatus\fP, which is a list of all \fBstatus\fP values of processes in a pipe. One difference is that not \%<> applies to \fB$status\fP, but not \fB$pipestatus\fP, because it loses information.
.sp
For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
not cat file | grep \-q fish
echo status is: $status pipestatus is $pipestatus
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Here \fB$status\fP reflects the status of \fBgrep\fP, which returns 0 if it found something, negated with \fBnot\fP (so 1 if it found something, 0 otherwise). \fB$pipestatus\fP reflects the status of \fBcat\fP (which returns non\-zero for example when it couldn\(aqt find the file) and \fBgrep\fP, without the negation.
.sp
So if both \fBcat\fP and \fBgrep\fP succeeded, \fB$status\fP would be 1 because of the \fBnot\fP, and \fB$pipestatus\fP would be 0 and 0.
.sp
It\(aqs possible for the first command to fail while the second succeeds. One common example is when the second program quits early.
.sp
For example, if you have a pipeline like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
cat file1 file2 | head \-n 50
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will tell \fBcat\fP to print two files, \(dqfile1\(dq and \(dqfile2\(dq, one after the other, and the \fBhead\fP will then only print the first 50 lines. In this case you might often see this constellation:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> cat file1 file2 | head \-n 50
# 50 lines of output
> echo $pipestatus
141 0
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Here, the \(dq141\(dq signifies that \fBcat\fP was killed by signal number 13 (128 + 13 == 141) \- a \fBSIGPIPE\fP\&. You can also use \fBfish_kill_signal\fP to see the signal number. This happens because it was still working, and then \fBhead\fP closed the pipe, so \fBcat\fP received a signal that it didn\(aqt ignore and so it died.
.sp
Whether \fBcat\fP here will see a SIGPIPE depends on how long the file is and how much it writes at once, so you might see a pipestatus of \(dq0 0\(dq, depending on the implementation. This is a general unix issue and not specific to fish. Some shells feature a \(dqpipefail\(dq feature that will call a pipeline failed if one of the processes in it failed, and this is a big problem with it.
.SS Locale Variables
.sp
The \(dqlocale\(dq of a program is its set of language and regional settings.
In UNIX, these are made up of several categories. The categories used by fish are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B LANG
This is the typical environment variable for specifying a locale.
A user may set this variable to express the language they speak, their region, and a character encoding.
The encoding part is ignored, fish always assumes UTF\-8. The actual values are specific to their platform, except for special values like \fBC\fP or \fBPOSIX\fP\&.
.sp
The value of \fBLANG\fP is used for each category unless the variable for that category was set or \fBLC_ALL\fP is set. So typically you only need to set LANG.
.sp
Example values are \fBen_US.UTF\-8\fP for the American English or \fBde_AT.UTF\-8\fP for Austrian German.
Your operating system might have a \fBlocale\fP command that you can call as \fBlocale \-a\fP to see a list of defined locales.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B LANGUAGE
This is treated like \fBLC_MESSAGES\fP except that it can hold multiple values,
which allows to specify a priority list of languages for translation.
It\(aqs a PATH variable, like in GNU gettext \%<https://\:www\:.gnu\:.org/\:software/\:gettext/\:manual/\:html_node/\:The-LANGUAGE-variable\:.html>\&.
.sp
Language identifiers without a region specified (e.g. \fBzh\fP) result in all available variants of this language being tried in arbitrary order.
In this example, we might first look for messages in the \fBzh_CN\fP catalog, followed by \fBzh_TW\fP, or the other way around.
This is different from GNU gettext, which uses a \(dqdefault\(dq variant of the language instead.
If you prefer a certain variant, specify it earlier in the list,
e.g. \fBzh_TW:zh\fP if your preferred language is \fBzh_TW\fP, and you prefer any other variants of \fBzh\fP over the English default.
If \fBzh_TW\fP is the only variant of \fBzh\fP you want,
specifying \fBzh_TW\fP in the \fBLANGUAGE\fP variable will result in messages which are not available in \fBzh_TW\fP being displayed in English.
.sp

.SS Command lookup
.sp

.sp
If it contains a \fB/\fP, fish tries to execute the given file, from the current directory on.
.sp
If it doesn\(aqt contain a \fB/\fP, it could be a function, builtin, or external command, and so fish goes through the full lookup.

If you run this as \fBshow_files /\fP, it will most likely ask you until you press Y/y or N/n. If you run this as \fBshow_files / | cat\fP, it will print the files without asking. If you run this as \fBshow_files .\fP, it might print something without asking because there are fewer than five files.
.SS Shell variable and function names
.sp
The names given to variables and functions (so\-called \(dqidentifiers\(dq) have to follow certain rules:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A variable name cannot be empty. It can contain only letters, digits, and underscores. It may begin and end with any of those characters.
.IP \(bu 2
A function name cannot be empty. It may not begin with a hyphen (\(dq\-\(dq) and may not contain a slash (\(dq/\(dq). All other characters, including a space, are valid. A function name also can\(aqt be the same as a reserved keyword or essential builtin like \fBif\fP or \fBset\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
A bind mode name (e.g., \fBbind \-m abc ...\fP) must be a valid variable name.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Other things have other restrictions. For instance what is allowed for file names depends on your system, but at the very least they cannot contain a \(dq/\(dq (because that is the path separator) or NULL byte (because that is how UNIX ends strings).
.SS Configuration files
.sp
When fish is started, it reads and runs its configuration files. Where these are depends on build configuration and environment variables.
.sp
The main file is \fB~/.config/fish/config.fish\fP (or more precisely \fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fish/config.fish\fP).
.sp
Configuration files are run in the following order:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Configuration snippets (named \fB*.fish\fP) in the directories:
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB$__fish_config_dir/conf.d\fP (by default, \fB~/.config/fish/conf.d/\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
\fB$__fish_sysconf_dir/conf.d\fP (by default, \fB/etc/fish/conf.d/\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
Directories for others to ship configuration snippets for their software:
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
the directories under \fB$__fish_user_data_dir\fP (usually \fB~/.local/share/fish\fP, controlled by the \fBXDG_DATA_HOME\fP environment variable)
.IP \(bu 2
a \fBfish/vendor_conf.d\fP directory in the directories listed in \fB$XDG_DATA_DIRS\fP (default \fB/usr/share/fish/vendor_conf.d\fP and \fB/usr/local/share/fish/vendor_conf.d\fP)
.UNINDENT
.sp
These directories are also accessible in \fB$__fish_vendor_confdirs\fP\&.
Note that changing that in a running fish won\(aqt do anything as by that point the directories have already been read.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If there are multiple files with the same name in these directories, only the first will be executed.
They are executed in order of their filename, sorted (like globs) in a natural order (i.e. \(dq01\(dq sorts before \(dq2\(dq).
.IP \(bu 2
System\-wide configuration files, where administrators can include initialization for all users on the system \- similar to \fB/etc/profile\fP for POSIX\-style shells \- in \fB$__fish_sysconf_dir\fP (usually \fB/etc/fish/config.fish\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
User configuration, usually in \fB~/.config/fish/config.fish\fP (controlled by the \fBXDG_CONFIG_HOME\fP environment variable, and accessible as \fB$__fish_config_dir\fP).
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB~/.config/fish/config.fish\fP is sourced \fIafter\fP the snippets. This is so you can copy snippets and override some of their behavior.
.sp
These files are all executed on the startup of every shell. If you want to run a command only on starting an interactive shell, use the exit status of the command \fBstatus \-\-is\-interactive\fP to determine if the shell is interactive. If you want to run a command only when using a login shell, use \fBstatus \-\-is\-login\fP instead. This will speed up the starting of non\-interactive or non\-login shells.
.sp
If you are developing another program, you may want to add configuration for all users of fish on a system. This is discouraged; if not carefully written, they may have side\-effects or slow the startup of the shell. Additionally, users of other shells won\(aqt benefit from the fish\-specific configuration. However, if they are required, you can install them to the \(dqvendor\(dq configuration directory. As this path may vary from system to system, \fBpkg\-config\fP should be used to discover it: \fBpkg\-config \-\-variable confdir fish\fP\&.
.sp
For system integration, fish also ships a file called \fB__fish_build_paths.fish\fP\&. This can be customized during build, for instance because your system requires special paths to be used.
.SS Future feature flags
.sp
Feature flags are how fish stages changes that might break scripts. Breaking changes are introduced as opt\-in, in a few releases they become opt\-out, and eventually the old behavior is removed.
.sp
You can see the current list of features via \fBstatus features\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> status features
stderr\-nocaret          on  3.0 ^ no longer redirects stderr
qmark\-noglob            on  3.0 ? no longer globs
regex\-easyesc           on  3.1 string replace \-r needs fewer \e\e\(aqs
ampersand\-nobg\-in\-token on  3.4 & only backgrounds if followed by a separating character
remove\-percent\-self     off 4.0 %self is no longer expanded (use $fish_pid)
test\-require\-arg        off 4.0 builtin test requires an argument
mark\-prompt             on  4.0 write OSC 133 prompt markers to the terminal
ignore\-terminfo         on  4.1 do not look up $TERM in terminfo database
query\-term              on  4.1 query the TTY to enable extra functionality
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Here is what they mean:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstderr\-nocaret\fP was introduced in fish 3.0 and cannot be turned off since fish 3.5. It can still be tested for compatibility, but a \fBno\-stderr\-nocaret\fP value will be ignored. The flag made \fB^\fP an ordinary character instead of denoting an stderr redirection. Use \fB2>\fP instead.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBqmark\-noglob\fP was also introduced in fish 3.0 (and made the default in 4.0). It makes \fB?\fP an ordinary character instead of a single\-character glob. Use a \fB*\fP instead (which will match multiple characters) or find other ways to match files like \fBfind\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBregex\-easyesc\fP was introduced in 3.1 (and made the default in 3.5). It makes it so the replacement expression in \fBstring replace \-r\fP does one fewer round of escaping. Before, to escape a backslash you would have to use \fBstring replace \-ra \(aq([ab])\(aq \(aq\e\e\e\e\e\e\e\e$1\(aq\fP\&. After, just \fB\(aq\e\e\e\e$1\(aq\fP is enough. Check your \fBstring replace\fP calls if you use this anywhere.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBampersand\-nobg\-in\-token\fP was introduced in fish 3.4 (and made the default in 3.5). It makes it so a \fB&\fP i no longer interpreted as the backgrounding operator in the middle of a token, so dealing with URLs becomes easier. Either put spaces or a semicolon after the \fB&\fP\&. This is recommended formatting anyway, and \fBfish_indent\fP will have done it for you already.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBremove\-percent\-self\fP turns off the special \fB%self\fP expansion. It was introduced in 4.0. To get fish\(aqs pid, you can use the \fBfish_pid\fP variable.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtest\-require\-arg\fP removes builtin test \%<>\(aqs one\-argument form (\fBtest \(dqstring\(dq\fP\&. It was introduced in 4.0. To test if a string is non\-empty, use \fBtest \-n \(dqstring\(dq\fP\&. If disabled, any call to \fBtest\fP that would change sends a debug message \%<#\:debugging-fish> of category \(dqdeprecated\-test\(dq, so starting fish with \fBfish \-\-debug=deprecated\-test\fP can be used to find offending calls.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmark\-prompt\fP makes fish report to the terminal the beginning and and of both shell prompts and command output.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBignore\-terminfo\fP disables lookup of $TERM in the terminfo database. Use \fBno\-ignore\-terminfo\fP to turn it back on.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBquery\-term\fP allows fish to query the terminal by writing escape sequences and reading the terminal\(aqs response.
This enables features such as scrolling \%<#\:term-compat-cursor-position-report>\&.
If you use an incompatible terminal, you can \-\- for the time being \-\- work around it by running (once) \fBset \-Ua fish_features no\-query\-term\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
These changes are introduced off by default. They can be enabled on a per session basis:

.sp
Features will only be set on startup, so this variable will only take effect if it is universal or exported.
.sp
You can also use the version as a group, so \fB3.0\fP is equivalent to \(dqstderr\-nocaret\(dq and \(dqqmark\-noglob\(dq. Instead of a version, the special group \fBall\fP enables all features.
.sp
Prefixing a feature with \fBno\-\fP turns it off instead. E.g. to reenable the \fB?\fP single\-character glob:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set \-Ua fish_features no\-qmark\-noglob
.EE

.UNINDENT
.SS Event handlers
.sp
When defining a new function in fish, it is possible to make it into an event handler, i.e. a function that is automatically run when a specific event takes place. Events that can trigger a handler currently are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
When a signal is delivered
.IP \(bu 2
When a job exits
.IP \(bu 2
When the value of a variable is updated
.IP \(bu 2
When the prompt is about to be shown
.UNINDENT
.sp
Example:
.sp
To specify a signal handler for the WINCH signal, write:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
function my_signal_handler \-\-on\-signal WINCH
    echo Got WINCH signal!
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Fish already has the following named events for the \fB\-\-on\-event\fP switch:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_prompt\fP is emitted whenever a new fish prompt is about to be displayed.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_preexec\fP is emitted right before executing an interactive command. The commandline is passed as the first parameter. Not emitted if command is empty.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_posterror\fP is emitted right after executing a command with syntax errors. The commandline is passed as the first parameter.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_postexec\fP is emitted right after executing an interactive command. The commandline is passed as the first parameter. Not emitted if command is empty.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_exit\fP is emitted right before fish exits.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_cancel\fP is emitted when a commandline is cleared.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_focus_in\fP is emitted when fish\(aqs terminal gains focus.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_focus_out\fP is emitted when fish\(aqs terminal loses focus.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Events can be fired with the emit \%<> command, and do not have to be defined before. The names just need to match. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
function handler \-\-on\-event imdone
    echo generator is done $argv
end

function generator
    sleep 1
    # The \(dqimdone\(dq is the name of the event
    # the rest is the arguments to pass to the handler
    emit imdone with $argv
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If there are multiple handlers for an event, they will all be run, but the order might change between fish releases, so you should not rely on it.
.sp
Please note that event handlers only become active when a function is loaded, which means you need to otherwise source \%<> or execute a function instead of relying on autoloading\&. One approach is to put it into your configuration file\&.
.sp
For more information on how to define new event handlers, see the documentation for the function \%<> command.
.SS Debugging fish scripts
.sp
Fish includes basic built\-in debugging facilities that allow you to stop execution of a script at an arbitrary point. When this happens you are presented with an interactive prompt where you can execute any fish command to inspect or change state (there are no debug commands as such). For example, you can check or change the value of any variables using printf \%<> and set \%<>\&. As another example, you can run status print\-stack\-trace \%<> to see how the current breakpoint was reached. To resume normal execution of the script, type exit \%<> or \fBctrl\fP\-\fBd\fP\&.
.sp
To start a debug session insert the builtin command \%<> \fBbreakpoint\fP at the point in a function or script where you wish to gain control, then run the function or script. Also, the default action of the \fBTRAP\fP signal is to call this builtin, meaning a running script can be actively debugged by sending it the \fBTRAP\fP signal (\fBkill \-s TRAP <PID>\fP). There is limited support for interactively setting or modifying breakpoints from this debug prompt: it is possible to insert new breakpoints in (or remove old ones from) other functions by using the \fBfunced\fP function to edit the definition of a function, but it is not possible to add or remove a breakpoint from the function/script currently loaded and being executed.
.sp
Another way to debug script issues is to set the \fBfish_trace\fP variable, e.g. \fBfish_trace=1 fish_prompt\fP to see which commands fish executes when running the fish_prompt \%<> function.
.SS Profiling fish scripts
.sp
If you specifically want to debug performance issues, \fBfish\fP can be run with the \fB\-\-profile /path/to/profile.log\fP option to save a profile to the specified path. This profile log includes a breakdown of how long each step in the execution took.
.sp
For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> fish \-\-profile /tmp/sleep.prof \-ic \(aqsleep 3s\(aq
> cat /tmp/sleep.prof
Time    Sum     Command
3003419 3003419 > sleep 3s
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will show the time for each command itself in the first column, the time for the command and every subcommand (like any commands inside of a function or command substitutions) in the second and the command itself in the third, separated with tabs.
.sp
The time is given in microseconds.
.sp
To see the slowest commands last, \fBsort \-nk2 /path/to/logfile\fP is useful.
.sp
For profiling fish\(aqs startup there is also \fB\-\-profile\-startup /path/to/logfile\fP\&.
.sp
See fish \%<> for more information.
.SS Commands
.sp
This is a list of all the commands fish ships with.
.sp
Broadly speaking, these fall into a few categories:
.SS Keywords

.SS _ \- call fish\(aqs translations
.SS Synopsis
.nf
\fB_\fP \fISTRING\fP
.fi
.sp
.SS Description
.sp
\fB_\fP translates its arguments into the current language, if possible.
.sp
This only works with messages which are translated as part of fish\(aqs own sources, so using it as part of your own fish scripts which are not upstreamed into the fish repo will not work unless the exact same message also exists upstream.
.sp
It requires fish to be built with gettext support. If that support is disabled or there is no translation it will echo the argument back.
.sp
The language depends on the current locale, set with \fBLANG\fP \%<#\:envvar-LANG>, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fP \%<#\:envvar-LC_MESSAGES>, \fBLC_ALL\fP \%<#\:envvar-LC_ALL>, and \fBLANGUAGE\fP \%<#\:envvar-LANGUAGE>\&.
These variables do not have to be exported for fish to use them, and fish\(aqs variable scopes are supported.
If other programs launched via fish should respect these locale variables they have to be exported to make them available outside of fish.
.sp
For \fBLANGUAGE\fP \%<#\:envvar-LANGUAGE> you can use a list, or use colons to separate multiple languages.
.SS Options

.SS Description
.sp
\fBabbr\fP manages abbreviations \- user\-defined words that are replaced with longer phrases when entered.
.sp
\fBNote:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Only typed\-in commands use abbreviations. Abbreviations are not expanded in scripts.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For example, a frequently\-run command like \fBgit checkout\fP can be abbreviated to \fBgco\fP\&.
After entering \fBgco\fP and pressing \fBspace\fP or \fBenter\fP, the full text \fBgit checkout\fP will appear in the command line.
To avoid expanding something that looks like an abbreviation, the default \fBctrl\fP\-\fBspace\fP binding inserts a space without expanding.
.sp
An abbreviation may match a literal word, or it may match a pattern given by a regular expression. When an abbreviation matches a word, that word is replaced by new text, called its \fIexpansion\fP\&. This expansion may be a fixed new phrase, or it can be dynamically created via a fish function. This expansion occurs after pressing space or enter.
.sp
Combining these features, it is possible to create custom syntaxes, where a regular expression recognizes matching tokens, and the expansion function interprets them. See the Examples section.
.sp
Changed in version 3.6.0: Previous versions of this allowed saving abbreviations in universal variables.
That\(aqs no longer possible. Existing variables will still be imported and \fBabbr \-\-erase\fP will also erase the variables.
We recommend adding abbreviations to config.fish \%<#\:configuration> by just adding the \fBabbr \-\-add\fP command.
When you run \fBabbr\fP, you will see output like this
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> abbr
abbr \-a \-\- foo bar # imported from a universal variable, see \(gahelp abbr\(ga
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In that case you should take the part before the \fB#\fP comment and save it in config.fish \%<#\:configuration>,
then you can run \fBabbr \-\-erase\fP to remove the universal variable:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> abbr >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
> abbr \-\-erase (abbr \-\-list)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Alternatively you can keep them in a separate configuration file \%<#\:configuration> by doing something like the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> abbr > ~/.config/fish/conf.d/myabbrs.fish
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will save all your abbreviations in \(dqmyabbrs.fish\(dq, overwriting the whole file so it doesn\(aqt leave any duplicates,
or restore abbreviations you had erased.
Of course any functions will have to be saved separately, see funcsave \%<>\&.

\fBabbr \-\-add\fP creates a new abbreviation. With no other options, the string \fBNAME\fP is replaced by \fBEXPANSION\fP\&.
.sp
With \fB\-\-position command\fP, the abbreviation will only expand when it is positioned as a command, not as an argument to another command. With \fB\-\-position anywhere\fP the abbreviation may expand anywhere in the command line. The default is \fBcommand\fP\&.
.sp
With \fB\-\-command COMMAND\fP, the abbreviation will only expand when it is used as an argument to the given COMMAND. Multiple \fB\-\-command\fP can be used together, and the abbreviation will expand for each. An empty \fBCOMMAND\fP means it will expand only when there is no command. \fB\-\-command\fP implies \fB\-\-position anywhere\fP and disallows \fB\-\-position command\fP\&. Even with different \fBCOMMANDS\fP, the \fBNAME\fP of the abbreviation needs to be unique. Consider using \fB\-\-regex\fP if you want to expand the same word differently for multiple commands.
.sp
With \fB\-\-regex\fP, the abbreviation matches using the regular expression given by \fBPATTERN\fP, instead of the literal \fBNAME\fP\&. The pattern is interpreted using PCRE2 syntax and must match the entire token. If multiple abbreviations match the same token, the last abbreviation added is used.
.sp
With \fB\-\-set\-cursor=MARKER\fP, the cursor is moved to the first occurrence of \fBMARKER\fP in the expansion. The \fBMARKER\fP value is erased. The \fBMARKER\fP may be omitted (i.e. simply \fB\-\-set\-cursor\fP), in which case it defaults to \fB%\fP\&.
.sp
With \fB\-f FUNCTION\fP or \fB\-\-function FUNCTION\fP, \fBFUNCTION\fP is treated as the name of a fish function instead of a literal replacement. When the abbreviation matches, the function will be called with the matching token as an argument. If the function\(aqs exit status is 0 (success), the token will be replaced by the function\(aqs output; otherwise the token will be left unchanged. No \fBEXPANSION\fP may be given separately.

.SS Synopsis
.nf
\fBargparse\fP [\fIOPTIONS\fP] \fIOPTION_SPEC\fP \&... \fB\-\-\fP [\fIARG\fP \&...]
.fi
.sp
.SS Description
.sp
This command makes it easy for fish scripts and functions to handle arguments. You pass arguments that define the known options, followed by a literal \fB\-\-\fP, then the arguments to be parsed (which might also include a literal \fB\-\-\fP). \fBargparse\fP then sets variables to indicate the passed options with their values, sets \fB$argv_opts\fP to the options and their values, and sets \fB$argv\fP to the remaining arguments. See the usage section below.
.sp
Each option specification (\fBOPTION_SPEC\fP) is written in the domain specific language described below. All OPTION_SPECs must appear after any argparse flags and before the \fB\-\-\fP that separates them from the arguments to be parsed.
.sp
Each option that is seen in the ARG list will result in variables named \fB_flag_X\fP, where \fBX\fP is the short flag letter and the long flag name (if they are defined). For example a \fB\-\-help\fP option could cause argparse to define one variable called \fB_flag_h\fP and another called \fB_flag_help\fP\&.
.sp
The variables will be set with local scope (i.e., as if the script had done \fBset \-l _flag_X\fP). If the flag is a boolean (that is, it is passed or not, it doesn\(aqt have a value) the values are the short and long flags seen. If the option is not a boolean the values will be zero or more values corresponding to the values collected when the ARG list is processed. If the flag was not seen the flag variable will not be set.
.SS Options
.sp
The following \fBargparse\fP options are available. They must appear before all \fIOPTION_SPEC\fPs:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-n\fP or \fB\-\-name\fP \fINAME\fP
Use \fINAME\fP in error messages. By default the current function name will be used, or \fBargparse\fP if run outside of a function.
.TP
\fB\-x\fP or \fB\-\-exclusive\fP \fIOPTIONS\fP
A comma separated list of options that are mutually exclusive. You can use this more than once to define multiple sets of mutually exclusive options.
You give either the short or long version of each option, and you still need to otherwise define the options.
.TP
\fB\-N\fP or \fB\-\-min\-args\fP \fINUMBER\fP
The minimum number of acceptable non\-option arguments. The default is zero.
.TP
\fB\-X\fP or \fB\-\-max\-args\fP \fINUMBER\fP
The maximum number of acceptable non\-option arguments. The default is infinity.
.TP
\fB\-u\fP or \fB\-\-move\-unknown\fP
Allow unknown options, and move them from \fB$argv\fP to \fB$argv_opts\fP\&. By default, Unknown options are treated as if they take optional arguments (i.e. have option spec \fB=?\fP).
.sp
The above means that if a group of short options contains an unknown short option \fIfollowed\fP by a known short option, the known short option is
treated as an argument to the unknown one (e.g. \fB\-\-move\-unknown h \-\- \-oh\fP will treat \fBh\fP as the argument to \fB\-o\fP, and so \fB_flag_h\fP will \fInot\fP be set).
In contrast, if the known option comes first (and does not take any arguments), the known option will be recognised (e.g. \fBargparse \-\-move\-unknown h \-\- \-ho\fP \fIwill\fP set \fB$_flag_h\fP to \fB\-h\fP)
.TP
\fB\-i\fP or \fB\-\-ignore\-unknown\fP
Deprecated. This is like \fB\-\-move\-unknown\fP, except that unknown options and their arguments are kept in \fB$argv\fP and not moved to \fB$argv_opts\fP\&. Unlike \fB\-\-move\-unknown\fP, this option makes it impossible to distinguish between an unknown option and non\-option argument that starts with a \fB\-\fP (since any \fB\-\-\fP seperator in \fB$argv\fP will be removed).
.TP
\fB\-S\fP or \fB\-\-strict\-longopts\fP
This makes the parsing of long options more strict. In particular, \fIwithout\fP this flag, if \fBlong\fP is a known long option flag, \fB\-\-long\fP and \fB\-\-long=<value>\fP can be abbreviated as:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-long\fP and \fB\-long=<value>\fP, but \fIonly\fP if there is no short flag \fBl\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-lo\fP and \fB\-\-lo=<value>\fP, but \fIonly\fP if there is no other long flag that starts with \fBlo\fP\&. Similarly with any other non\-empty prefix of \fBlong\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-lo\fP and \fB\-lo=<value>\fP (i.e. combining the above two).
.UNINDENT
.sp
With the \fB\-\-strict\-longopts\fP flag, the above three are parse errors: one must use the syntax \fB\-\-long\fP or \fB\-\-long=<value>\fP to use a long option called \fBlong\fP\&.
.sp
This flag has no effect on the parsing of unknown options (which are parsed as if this flag is on).
.sp
This option may be on all the time in the future, so do not rely on the behaviour without it.
.TP
\fB\-\-unknown\-arguments\fP \fIKIND\fP
This option implies \fB\-\-move\-unknown\fP, unless \fB\-\-ignore\-unknown\fP is also given.
This will modify the parsing behaviour of unknown options depending on the value of \fIKIND\fP:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBoptional\fP (the default), allows each unknown option to take an optional argument (i.e. as if it had \fB=?\fP or \fB=*\fP in its option specification). For example, \fBargparse \-\-ignore\-unknown \-\-unknown\-arguments=optional ab \-\- \-u \-a \-ub\fP will set \fB_flag_a\fP but \fInot\fP \fB_flag_b\fP, as the \fBb\fP is treated as an argument to the second use of \fB\-u\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBrequired\fP requires each unknown option to take an argument (i.e. as if it had \fB=\fP or \fB=+\fP in its option specification). If the above example was changed to use \fB\-\-unknown\-arguments=required\fP, \fIneither\fP \fB_flag_a\fP nor \fB_flag_b\fP would be set: the \fB\-a\fP will be treated as an argument to the first use of \fB\-u\fP, and the \fBb\fP as an argument to the second.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnone\fP forbids each unknown option from taking an argument (i.e. as if it had no \fB=\fP in its option specification). If the above example was changed to use \fB\-\-unknown\-arguments=none\fP, \fIboth\fP \fB_flag_a\fP and \fB_flag_b\fP would be set, as neither use of \fB\-u\fP will be passed as taking an argument.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that the above assumes that unknown long flags use the \fB\-\-\fP \(dqGNU\-style\(dq (e.g. if \fIKIND\fP is \fBnone\fP, and there is no \fBbar\fP long option, \fB\-bar\fP is interpreted as three short flags, \fBb\fP, \fBa\fP, and \fBr\fP; but if \fBbar\fP is known, \fB\-bar\fP is treated the same as \fB\-\-bar\fP).
.sp
When using \fB\-\-unknown\-arguments=required\fP, you will get an error if the provided arguments end in an unknown option, since it has no argument. Similarly, with \fB\-\-unknown\-arguments=none\fP, you will get an error if you use the \fB\-\-flag=value\fP syntax and \fBflag\fP is an unknown option.
.UNINDENT

.UNINDENT
.SS Usage
.sp
To use this command, pass the option specifications (\fBOPTION_SPEC\fP), a mandatory \fB\-\-\fP, and then the arguments to be parsed.
.sp
A simple example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
argparse \(aqh/help\(aq \(aqn/name=\(aq \-\- $argv
or return
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If \fB$argv\fP is empty then there is nothing to parse and \fBargparse\fP returns zero to indicate success. If \fB$argv\fP is not empty then it is checked for flags \fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP, \fB\-n\fP and \fB\-\-name\fP\&. If they are found they are removed from the arguments and local variables called \fB_flag_OPTION\fP are set so the script can determine which options were seen. If \fB$argv\fP doesn\(aqt have any errors, like an unknown option or a missing mandatory value for an option, then \fBargparse\fP exits with a status of zero. Otherwise it writes appropriate error messages to stderr and exits with a status of one.
.sp
The \fBor return\fP means that the function returns \fBargparse\fP\(aqs status if it failed, so if it goes on \fBargparse\fP succeeded.
.sp
To use the flags argparse has extracted:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# Checking for _flag_h and _flag_help is equivalent
# We check if it has been given at least once
if set \-ql _flag_h
    echo \(dqUsage: my_function [\-h | \-\-help] [\-n | \-\-name=NAME]\(dq >&2
    return 1
end

set \-l myname somedefault
set \-ql _flag_name[1]
and set myname $_flag_name[\-1] # here we use the *last* \-\-name=
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Any characters in the flag name that are not valid in a variable name (like \fB\-\fP dashes) will be replaced with underscores.
.sp
The \fB\-\-\fP argument is required. You do not have to include any option specifications or arguments after the \fB\-\-\fP but you must include the \fB\-\-\fP\&. For example, this is acceptable:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set \-l argv foo
argparse \(aqh/help\(aq \(aqn/name\(aq \-\- $argv
argparse \-\-min\-args=1 \-\- $argv
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
But this is not:

.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set \-l argv
argparse \(aqh/help\(aq \(aqn/name\(aq $argv
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The first \fB\-\-\fP seen is what allows the \fBargparse\fP command to reliably separate the option specifications and options to \fBargparse\fP itself (like \fB\-\-move\-unknown\fP) from the command arguments, so it is required.
.SS Option Specifications
.sp
Each option specification consists of:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
An optional alphanumeric short flag character.
.IP \(bu 2
An optional long flag name preceded by a \fB/\fP\&. If neither a short flag nor long flag are present, an error is reported.
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If there is no short flag, and the long flag name is more than one character, the \fB/\fP can be omitted.
.IP \(bu 2
For backwards compatibility, if there is a short and a long flag, a \fB\-\fP can be used in place of the \fB/\fP, if the short flag is not to be usable by users (in which case it will also not be exposed as a flag variable).
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
Nothing if the flag is a boolean that takes no argument or is an integer flag, or
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB=\fP if it requires a value and only the last instance of the flag is saved, or
.IP \(bu 2
\fB=?\fP if it takes an optional value and only the last instance of the flag is saved, or
.IP \(bu 2
\fB=+\fP if it requires a value and each instance of the flag is saved, or
.IP \(bu 2
\fB=*\fP if it takes an optional value \fIand\fP each instance of the flag is saved, storing the empty string when the flag was not given a value.
.UNINDENT

\fB!\fP followed by fish script to validate the value. Typically this will be a function to run. If the exit status is zero the value for the flag is valid. If non\-zero the value is invalid.

.sp
See the fish_opt \%<> command for a friendlier but more verbose way to create option specifications.
.sp
If a flag is not seen when parsing the arguments then the corresponding _flag_X var(s) will not be set.
.SS Integer flag
.sp
Sometimes commands take numbers directly as options, like \fBfoo \-55\fP\&. To allow this one option spec can have the \fB#\fP modifier so that any integer will be understood as this flag, and the last number will be given as its value (as if \fB=\fP was used).
.sp
The \fB#\fP must follow the short flag letter (if any), and other modifiers like \fB=\fP are not allowed, except for \fB\-\fP (for backwards compatibility):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
m#maximum
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This does not read numbers given as \fB+NNN\fP, only those that look like flags \- \fB\-NNN\fP\&.
.SS Note: Optional arguments
.sp
An option defined with \fB=?\fP or \fB=*\fP can take optional arguments. Optional arguments have to be \fIdirectly attached\fP to the option they belong to.
.sp
That means the argument will only be used for the option if you use it like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
cmd \-\-flag=value
# or
cmd  \-fvalue
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
but not if used like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
cmd \-\-flag value
# \(dqvalue\(dq here will be used as a positional argument
# and \(dq\-\-flag\(dq won\(aqt have an argument.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If this weren\(aqt the case, using an option without an optional argument would be difficult if you also wanted to use positional arguments.
.sp
For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
grep \-\-color auto
# Here \(dqauto\(dq will be used as the search string,
# \(dqcolor\(dq will not have an argument and will fall back to the default,
# which also *happens to be* auto.
grep \-\-color always
# Here grep will still only use color \(dqauto\(dqmatically
# and search for the string \(dqalways\(dq.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This isn\(aqt specific to argparse but common to all things using \fBgetopt(3)\fP (if they have optional arguments at all). That \fBgrep\fP example is how GNU grep actually behaves.
.SS Flag Value Validation
.sp
Sometimes you need to validate the option values. For example, that it is a valid integer within a specific range, or an ip address, or something entirely different. You can always do this after \fBargparse\fP returns but you can also request that \fBargparse\fP perform the validation by executing arbitrary fish script. To do so append an \fB!\fP (exclamation\-mark) then the fish script to be run. When that code is executed three vars will be defined:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB_argparse_cmd\fP will be set to the value of the value of the \fBargparse \-\-name\fP value.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB_flag_name\fP will be set to the short or long flag that being processed.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB_flag_value\fP will be set to the value associated with the flag being processed.

Fish ships with a \fB_validate_int\fP function that accepts a \fB\-\-min\fP and \fB\-\-max\fP flag. Let\(aqs say your command accepts a \fB\-m\fP or \fB\-\-max\fP flag and the minimum allowable value is zero and the maximum is 5. You would define the option like this: \fBm/max=!_validate_int \-\-min 0 \-\-max 5\fP\&. The default if you call \fB_validate_int\fP without those flags is to check that the value is a valid integer with no limits on the min or max value allowed.

Some \fIOPTION_SPEC\fP examples:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBh/help\fP means that both \fB\-h\fP and \fB\-\-help\fP are valid. The flag is a boolean and can be used more than once. If either flag is used then \fB_flag_h\fP and \fB_flag_help\fP will be set to however either flag was seen, as many times as it was seen. So it could be set to \fB\-h\fP, \fB\-h\fP and \fB\-\-help\fP, and \fBcount $_flag_h\fP would yield \(dq3\(dq.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBhelp\fP means that only \fB\-\-help\fP is valid. The flag is a boolean and can be used more than once. If it is used then \fB_flag_help\fP will be set as above. Also \fBh\-help\fP (with an arbitrary short letter) for backwards compatibility.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBhelp&\fP is similar (it will \fIremove\fP \fB\-\-help\fP from \fB$argv\fP), the difference is that \fB\-\-help\(ga\fP will \fInot\fP placed in \fB$argv_opts\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBlongonly=\fP is a flag \fB\-\-longonly\fP that requires an option, there is no short flag or even short flag variable.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBn/name=\fP means that both \fB\-n\fP and \fB\-\-name\fP are valid. It requires a value and can be used at most once. If the flag is seen then \fB_flag_n\fP and \fB_flag_name\fP will be set with the single mandatory value associated with the flag.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBn/name=?\fP means that both \fB\-n\fP and \fB\-\-name\fP are valid. It accepts an optional value and can be used at most once. If the flag is seen then \fB_flag_n\fP and \fB_flag_name\fP will be set with the value associated with the flag if one was provided else it will be set with no values.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBn/name=*\fP is similar, but the flag can be used more than once. If the flag is seen then \fB_flag_n\fP and \fB_flag_name\fP will be set with the values associated with each occurence. Each value will be the value given to the option, or the empty string if no value was given.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBname=+\fP means that only \fB\-\-name\fP is valid. It requires a value and can be used more than once. If the flag is seen then \fB_flag_name\fP will be set with the values associated with each occurrence.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBx\fP means that only \fB\-x\fP is valid. It is a boolean that can be used more than once. If it is seen then \fB_flag_x\fP will be set as above.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB/x\fP is similar, but only \fB\-\-x\fP is valid (instead of \fB\-x\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBx=\fP, \fBx=?\fP, and \fBx=+\fP are similar to the n/name examples above but there is no long flag alternative to the short flag \fB\-x\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB#max\fP (or \fB#\-max\fP) means that flags matching the regex \(dq^\-\-?\ed+$\(dq are valid. When seen they are assigned to the variable \fB_flag_max\fP\&. This allows any valid positive or negative integer to be specified by prefixing it with a single \(dq\-\(dq. Many commands support this idiom. For example \fBhead \-3 /a/file\fP to emit only the first three lines of /a/file.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBn#max\fP means that flags matching the regex \(dq^\-\-?\ed+$\(dq are valid. When seen they are assigned to the variables \fB_flag_n\fP and \fB_flag_max\fP\&. This allows any valid positive or negative integer to be specified by prefixing it with a single \(dq\-\(dq. Many commands support this idiom. For example \fBhead \-3 /a/file\fP to emit only the first three lines of /a/file. You can also specify the value using either flag: \fB\-n NNN\fP or \fB\-\-max NNN\fP in this example.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB#longonly\fP causes the last integer option to be stored in \fB_flag_longonly\fP\&.

After parsing the arguments the \fBargv\fP variable is set with local scope to any values not already consumed during flag processing. If there are no unbound values the variable is set but \fBcount $argv\fP will be zero. Similarly, the \fBargv_opts\fP variable is set with local scope to the arguments that \fIwere\fP consumed during flag processing. This allows forwarding \fB$argv_opts\fP to another command, together with additional arguments.
.sp
If an error occurs during argparse processing it will exit with a non\-zero status and print error messages to stderr.

There are a variety of boolean flags, all with long and short versions. A few of these cannot be used together, and that is what the \fB\-x\fP flag is used for.
\fB\-x g,U\fP means that \fB\-\-global\fP and \fB\-\-universal\fP or their short equivalents conflict, and if they are used together you get an error.
In this case you only need to give the short or long flag, not the full option specification.

The argparse call above saves all the options we do \fInot\fP want to process in \fB$argv_opts\fP\&. (The \fB\-\-qwords\fP and \fB\-\-bytes\fP options are \fInot\fP saved there as their option spec\(aqs end in a \fB~\fP). The code then processes the \fB\-\-qwords\fP and \fB\-\-bytess\fP options using the the \fB$_flag_OPTION\fP variables, and puts the transformed options in \fB$argv_opts\fP (which already contains all the original options, \fIother\fP than \fB\-\-qwords\fP and \fB\-\-bytes\fP).
.sp
Note that because the \fBargparse\fP call above uses \fB\-\-move\-unknown\fP and \fB\-\-unknown\-arguments=none\fP, we only need to tell it the arguments to \fBhead\fP that take a value. This allows the wrapper script to accurately work out the \fInon\fP\-option arguments (i.e. \fB$argv\fP, the filenames that \fBhead\fP is to operate on). Using \fB\-\-unknown\-arguments=optional\fP and explicitly listing all the known options to \fBhead\fP however would have the advantage that if \fBhead\fP were to add new options, they could still be used with the wrapper script using the \(dqstuck\(dq form for arguments (e.g. \fB\-o<arg>\fP, or \fB\-\-opt=<arg>\fP).
.sp
Note that the \fB\-\-strict\-longopts\fP is required to be able to correctly pass short options, e.g. without it \fBmy\-head \-q \-\-bytes 10q\fP, will actually parse the \fB\-q\fP as shorthand for \fB\-\-qwords\fP\&.

\fBbind\fP manages key bindings.
.sp
If both \fBKEYS\fP and \fBCOMMAND\fP are given, \fBbind\fP adds (or replaces) a binding in \fBMODE\fP\&.
If only \fBKEYS\fP is given, any existing binding for those keys in the given \fBMODE\fP will be printed.
If no \fBKEYS\fP argument is provided, all bindings (in the given \fBMODE\fP) are printed.
.sp
\fBKEYS\fP is a comma\-separated list of key names.
Modifier keys can be specified by prefixing a key name with a combination of \fBctrl\-\fP, \fBalt\-\fP, \fBshift\-\fP and \fBsuper\-\fP (i.e. the \(dqwindows\(dq or \(dqcommand\(dq key).
For example, pressing \fBw\fP while holding the Alt modifier is written as \fBalt\-w\fP\&.
Key names are case\-sensitive; for example \fBalt\-W\fP is the same as \fBalt\-shift\-w\fP\&.
\fBctrl\-x,ctrl\-e\fP would mean pressing \fBctrl\fP\-\fBx\fP followed by \fBctrl\fP\-\fBe\fP\&.
.sp
Some keys have names, usually because they don\(aqt have an obvious printable character representation.
They are:
.INDENT 0.0

.sp
These names are case\-sensitive.
.sp
An empty value (\fB\(aq\(aq\fP) for \fBKEYS\fP designates the generic binding that will be used if nothing else matches. For most bind modes, it makes sense to bind this to the \fBself\-insert\fP function (i.e. \fBbind \(aq\(aq self\-insert\fP). This will insert any keystrokes that have no bindings otherwise. Non\-printable characters are ignored by the editor, so this will not result in control sequences being inserted.
.sp
To find the name of a key combination you can use fish_key_reader \%<>\&.
.sp
\fBCOMMAND\fP can be any fish command, but it can also be one of a set of special input functions. These include functions for moving the cursor, operating on the kill\-ring, performing tab completion, etc. Use \fBbind \-\-function\-names\fP or see below for a list of these input functions.

Key bindings may use \(dqmodes\(dq, which mimics vi\(aqs modal input behavior. The default mode is \(dqdefault\(dq (in vi\-mode, that\(aqs vi\(aqs \(dqnormal\(dq mode). Every key binding applies to a single mode; you can specify which one with \fB\-M MODE\fP\&. If the key binding should change the mode, you can specify the new mode with \fB\-m NEW_MODE\fP\&. The mode can be viewed and changed via the \fB$fish_bind_mode\fP variable. If you want to change the mode from inside a fish function, use \fBset fish_bind_mode MODE\fP\&.
.sp
To save custom key bindings, put the \fBbind\fP statements into config.fish \%<#\:configuration>\&. Alternatively, fish also automatically executes a function called \fBfish_user_key_bindings\fP if it exists.

Erase the binding with the given sequence and mode instead of defining a new one.
Multiple sequences can be specified with this flag.
Specifying \fB\-a\fP or \fB\-\-all\fP with \fB\-M\fP or \fB\-\-mode\fP erases all binds in the given mode regardless of sequence.
Specifying \fB\-a\fP or \fB\-\-all\fP without \fB\-M\fP or \fB\-\-mode\fP erases all binds in all modes regardless of sequence.

\fB\-\-preset\fP and \fB\-\-user\fP
Specify if bind should operate on user or preset bindings.
User bindings take precedence over preset bindings when fish looks up mappings.
By default, all \fBbind\fP invocations work on the \(dquser\(dq level except for listing, which will show both levels.
All invocations except for inserting new bindings can operate on both levels at the same time (if both \fB\-\-preset\fP and \fB\-\-user\fP are given).
\fB\-\-preset\fP should only be used in full binding sets (like when working on \fBfish_vi_key_bindings\fP).

.SS Terminal Limitations
.sp
Unix terminals, like the ones fish operates in, are at heart 70s technology. They have some limitations that applications running inside them can\(aqt workaround.
.sp
For instance, historically the control key modifies a character by setting the top three bits to 0. This means:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Many characters + control are indistinguishable from other keys: \fBctrl\fP\-\fBi\fP \fIis\fP \fBtab\fP, \fBctrl\fP\-\fBj\fP \fIis\fP newline (\fB\en\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Control and shift don\(aqt work simultaneously \- \fBctrl\fP\-\fBX\fP is the same as \fBctrl\fP\-\fBx\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Other keys don\(aqt have a direct encoding, and are sent as escape sequences. For example \fBright\fP (\fB→\fP) usually sends \fB\ee\e[C\fP\&.
.sp
Some modern terminals support newer encodings for keys, that allow distinguishing more characters and modifiers, and fish enables as many of these as it can, automatically.
.sp
When in doubt, run fish_key_reader \- explore what characters keyboard keys send \%<>\&. If that tells you that pressing \fBctrl\fP\-\fBi\fP sends tab, your terminal does not support these better encodings, and so fish is limited to what it sends.
.SS Key timeout
.sp
When you\(aqve bound a sequence of multiple characters, there is always the possibility that fish has only seen a part of it, and then it needs to disambiguate between the full sequence and part of it.
.sp
For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
bind j,k \(aqcommandline \-i foo\(aq
# or \(gabind jk\(ga
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
will bind the sequence \fBjk\fP to insert \(dqfoo\(dq into the commandline. When you\(aqve only pressed \(dqj\(dq, fish doesn\(aqt know if it should insert the \(dqj\(dq (because of the default self\-insert), or wait for the \(dqk\(dq.
.sp
You can enable a timeout for this, by setting the \fBfish_sequence_key_delay_ms\fP \%<#\:envvar-fish_sequence_key_delay_ms> variable to the timeout in milliseconds. If the timeout elapses, fish will no longer wait for the sequence to be completed, and do what it can with the characters it already has.
.sp
The escape key is a special case, because it can be used standalone as a real key or as part of a longer escape sequence, like function or arrow keys. Holding alt and something else also typically sends escape, for example holding alt+a will send an escape character and then an \(dqa\(dq. So the escape character has its own timeout configured with \fBfish_escape_delay_ms\fP \%<#\:envvar-fish_escape_delay_ms>\&.
.sp

.SS Description
.sp
\fBswitch\fP executes one of several blocks of commands, depending on whether a specified value matches one of several values. \fBcase\fP is used together with the \fBswitch\fP statement in order to determine which block should be executed.
.sp
Each \fBcase\fP command is given one or more parameters. The first \fBcase\fP command with a parameter that matches the string specified in the switch command will be evaluated. \fBcase\fP parameters may contain wildcards. These need to be escaped or quoted in order to avoid regular wildcard expansion using filenames.
.sp
Note that fish does not fall through on case statements. Only the first matching case is executed.
.sp
Note that command substitutions in a case statement will be evaluated even if its body is not taken. All substitutions, including command substitutions, must be performed before the value can be compared against the parameter.
.SS Example
.sp
Say $animal contains the name of an animal. Then this code would classify it:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX

    case shark trout stingray
        echo fish
    # Note that the next case has a wildcard which is quoted
    case \(aq*\(aq

end

\fBcd\fP changes the current working directory.
.sp
If \fIDIRECTORY\fP is given, it will become the new directory. If no parameter is given, the \fBHOME\fP \%<#\:envvar-HOME> environment variable will be used.
.sp
If \fIDIRECTORY\fP is a relative path, all the paths in the \fBCDPATH\fP \%<#\:envvar-CDPATH> will be tried as prefixes for it, in addition to \fBPWD\fP \%<#\:envvar-PWD>\&.
It is recommended to keep \fB\&.\fP as the first element of \fBCDPATH\fP \%<#\:envvar-CDPATH>, or \fBPWD\fP \%<#\:envvar-PWD> will be tried last.
.sp
Fish will also try to change directory if given a command that looks like a directory (starting with \fB\&.\fP, \fB/\fP or \fB~\fP, or ending with \fB/\fP), without explicitly requiring \fBcd\fP\&.
.sp
Fish also ships a wrapper function around the builtin \fBcd\fP that understands \fBcd \-\fP as changing to the previous directory.
See also prevd \%<>\&.
This wrapper function maintains a history of the 25 most recently visited directories in the \fB$dirprev\fP and \fB$dirnext\fP global variables.
If you make those universal variables your \fBcd\fP history is shared among all fish instances.
.sp
As a special case, \fBcd .\fP is equivalent to \fBcd $PWD\fP, which is useful in cases where a mountpoint has been recycled or a directory has been removed and recreated.

If combined with \fB\-\-tokens\-expanded\fP, this will print up until the last completed token \- excluding the token the cursor is in.
This is typically what you would want for instance in completions.
To get both, use both \fBcommandline \-\-cut\-at\-cursor \-\-tokens\-expanded; commandline \-\-cut\-at\-cursor \-\-current\-token\fP,
or \fBcommandline \-cx; commandline \-ct\fP for short.
.TP
\fB\-x\fP or \fB\-\-tokens\-expanded\fP
Perform argument expansion on the selection and print one argument per line.
Command substitutions are not expanded but forwarded as\-is.

If \fBcommandline\fP is called during a call to complete a given string using \fBcomplete \-C STRING\fP, \fBcommandline\fP will consider the specified string to be the current contents of the command line.

The following options output metadata about the commandline state:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-L\fP or \fB\-\-line\fP
If no argument is given, print the line that the cursor is on, with the topmost line starting at 1.
Otherwise, set the cursor to the given line.
.TP
\fB\-\-column\fP
If no argument is given, print the 1\-based offset from the start of the line to the cursor position in Unicode code points.
Otherwise, set the cursor to the given code point offset.
.TP
\fB\-S\fP or \fB\-\-search\-mode\fP
Evaluates to true if the commandline is performing a history search.
.TP
\fB\-P\fP or \fB\-\-paging\-mode\fP
Evaluates to true if the commandline is showing pager contents, such as tab completions.
.TP
\fB\-\-paging\-full\-mode\fP
Evaluates to true if the commandline is showing pager contents, such as tab completions and all lines are shown (no \(dq<n> more rows\(dq message).
.TP
\fB\-\-is\-valid\fP
Returns true when the commandline is syntactically valid and complete.
If it is, it would be executed when the \fBexecute\fP bind function is called.
If the commandline is incomplete, return 2, if erroneous, return 1.
.TP
\fB\-\-showing\-suggestion\fP
Evaluates to true (i.e. returns 0) when the shell is currently showing an automatic history completion/suggestion, available to be consumed via one of the \fIforward\-\fP bindings.
For example, can be used to determine if moving the cursor to the right when already at the end of the line would have no effect or if it would cause a completion to be accepted (note that \fIforward\-char\-passive\fP does this automatically).

the fish manual.
.sp
The following options are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-c\fP or \fB\-\-command\fP \fICOMMAND\fP
Specifies that \fICOMMAND\fP is the name of the command. If there is no \fB\-c\fP or \fB\-p\fP, one non\-option argument will be used as the command.
.TP
\fB\-p\fP or \fB\-\-path\fP \fICOMMAND\fP
Specifies that \fICOMMAND\fP is the absolute path of the command (optionally containing wildcards).
.TP
\fB\-e\fP or \fB\-\-erase\fP
Deletes the specified completion.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP or \fB\-\-short\-option\fP \fISHORT_OPTION\fP
Adds a short option to the completions list.
.TP
\fB\-l\fP or \fB\-\-long\-option\fP \fILONG_OPTION\fP
Adds a GNU\-style long option to the completions list.
.TP
\fB\-o\fP or \fB\-\-old\-option\fP \fIOPTION\fP
Adds an old\-style short or long option (see below for details).
.TP
\fB\-a\fP or \fB\-\-arguments\fP \fIARGUMENTS\fP
Adds the specified option arguments to the completions list.
.TP
\fB\-k\fP or \fB\-\-keep\-order\fP
Keeps the order of \fIARGUMENTS\fP instead of sorting alphabetically. Multiple \fBcomplete\fP calls with \fB\-k\fP result in arguments of the later ones displayed first.
.TP
\fB\-f\fP or \fB\-\-no\-files\fP
This completion may not be followed by a filename.
.TP
\fB\-F\fP or \fB\-\-force\-files\fP
This completion may be followed by a filename, even if another applicable \fBcomplete\fP specified \fB\-\-no\-files\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-r\fP or \fB\-\-require\-parameter\fP
This completion must have an option argument, i.e. may not be followed by another option.
This means that the next argument is the argument to the option.
If this is \fInot\fP given, the option argument must be attached like \fB\-xFoo\fP or \fB\-\-color=auto\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-x\fP or \fB\-\-exclusive\fP
Short for \fB\-r\fP and \fB\-f\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-d\fP or \fB\-\-description\fP \fIDESCRIPTION\fP
Add a description for this completion, to be shown in the completion pager.
.TP
\fB\-w\fP or \fB\-\-wraps\fP \fIWRAPPED_COMMAND\fP
Causes the specified command to inherit completions from \fIWRAPPED_COMMAND\fP\&.
This is used for \(dqthis command completes like that other command\(dq kinds of relationships.
See below for details.
.TP
\fB\-n\fP or \fB\-\-condition\fP \fICONDITION\fP
This completion should only be used if the \fICONDITION\fP (a shell command) returns 0. This makes it possible to specify completions that should only be used in some cases. If multiple conditions are specified, fish will try them in the order they are specified until one fails or all succeeded.
.TP
\fB\-C\fP or \fB\-\-do\-complete\fP \fISTRING\fP
Makes \fBcomplete\fP try to find all possible completions for the specified string. If there is no \fISTRING\fP, the current commandline is used instead.
.TP
\fB\-\-escape\fP
When used with \fB\-C\fP, escape special characters in completions.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP or \fB\-\-help\fP

.sp
Command\-specific tab\-completions in \fBfish\fP are based on the notion of options and arguments. An option is a parameter which begins with a hyphen, such as \fB\-h\fP, \fB\-help\fP or \fB\-\-help\fP\&. Arguments are parameters that do not begin with a hyphen. Fish recognizes three styles of options, the same styles as the GNU getopt library. These styles are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Short options, like \fB\-a\fP\&. Short options are a single character long, are preceded by a single hyphen and can be grouped together (like \fB\-la\fP, which is equivalent to \fB\-l \-a\fP). Option arguments may be specified by appending the option with the value (\fB\-w32\fP), or, if \fB\-\-require\-parameter\fP is given, in the following parameter (\fB\-w 32\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Old\-style options, long like \fB\-Wall\fP or \fB\-name\fP or even short like \fB\-a\fP\&. Old\-style options can be more than one character long, are preceded by a single hyphen and may not be grouped together. Option arguments are specified by default following a space (\fB\-foo null\fP) or after \fB=\fP (\fB\-foo=null\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
GNU\-style long options, like \fB\-\-colors\fP\&. GNU\-style long options can be more than one character long, are preceded by two hyphens, and can\(aqt be grouped together. Option arguments may be specified after a \fB=\fP (\fB\-\-quoting\-style=shell\fP), or, if \fB\-\-require\-parameter\fP is given, in the following parameter (\fB\-\-quoting\-style shell\fP).
.UNINDENT
.sp
Multiple commands and paths can be given in one call to define the same completions for multiple commands.
.sp
Multiple command switches and wrapped commands can also be given to define multiple completions in one call.
.sp
Invoking \fBcomplete\fP multiple times for the same command adds the new definitions on top of any existing completions defined for the command.
.sp
When \fB\-a\fP or \fB\-\-arguments\fP is specified in conjunction with long, short, or old\-style options, the specified arguments are only completed as arguments for any of the specified options. If \fB\-a\fP or \fB\-\-arguments\fP is specified without any long, short, or old\-style options, the specified arguments are used when completing non\-option arguments to the command (except when completing an option argument that was specified with \fB\-r\fP or \fB\-\-require\-parameter\fP).
.sp
Command substitutions found in \fBARGUMENTS\fP should return a newline\-separated list of arguments, and each argument may optionally have a tab character followed by the argument description. Description given this way override a description given with \fB\-d\fP or \fB\-\-description\fP\&.
.sp
Descriptions given with \fB\-\-description\fP are also used to group options given with \fB\-s\fP, \fB\-o\fP or \fB\-l\fP\&. Options with the same (non\-empty) description will be listed as one candidate, and one of them will be picked. If the description is empty or no description was given this is skipped.
.sp
The \fB\-w\fP or \fB\-\-wraps\fP options causes the specified command to inherit completions from another command, \(dqwrapping\(dq the other command. The wrapping command can also have additional completions. A command can wrap multiple commands, and wrapping is transitive: if A wraps B, and B wraps C, then A automatically inherits all of C\(aqs completions. Wrapping can be removed using the \fB\-e\fP or \fB\-\-erase\fP options. Wrapping only works for completions specified with \fB\-c\fP or \fB\-\-command\fP and are ignored when specifying completions with \fB\-p\fP or \fB\-\-path\fP\&.
.sp
When erasing completions, it is possible to either erase all completions for a specific command by specifying \fBcomplete \-c COMMAND \-e\fP, or by specifying a specific completion option to delete.
.sp
When \fBcomplete\fP is called without anything that would define or erase completions (options, arguments, wrapping, ...), it shows matching completions instead. So \fBcomplete\fP without any arguments shows all loaded completions, \fBcomplete \-c foo\fP shows all loaded completions for \fBfoo\fP\&. Since completions are autoloaded \%<#\:syntax-function-autoloading>, you will have to trigger them first.
.SS Examples

The \fBrpm\fP command has several different modes. If the \fB\-e\fP or \fB\-\-erase\fP flag has been specified, \fBrpm\fP should delete one or more packages, in which case several switches related to deleting packages are valid, like the \fBnodeps\fP switch.

.SS Description
.sp
\fBdisown\fP removes the specified job \%<#\:syntax-job-control> from the list of jobs. The job itself continues to exist, but fish does not keep track of it any longer.
This will make fish lose all knowledge of the job, so functions defined with \fB\-\-on\-process\-exit\fP or \fB\-\-on\-job\-exit\fP will no longer fire.
.sp
Jobs in the list of jobs are sent a hang\-up signal when fish terminates, which usually causes the job to terminate; \fBdisown\fP allows these processes to continue regardless.
.sp
If no process is specified, the most recently\-used job is removed (like bg \%<> and fg \%<>).  If one or more PIDs are specified, jobs with the specified process IDs are removed from the job list. Invalid jobs are ignored and a warning is printed.
.sp
If a job is stopped, it is sent a signal to continue running, and a warning is printed. It is not possible to use the bg \%<> builtin to continue a job once it has been disowned.
.sp
\fBdisown\fP returns 0 if all specified jobs were disowned successfully, and 1 if any problems were encountered.

.SS Debugging
.sp
While fish provides extensive support for debugging fish scripts \%<#\:debugging>, it is also possible to debug and instrument its internals.
Debugging can be enabled by passing the \fB\-\-debug\fP option.
For example, the following command turns on debugging for background IO thread events, in addition to the default categories, i.e. \fIdebug\fP, \fIerror\fP, \fIwarning\fP, and \fIwarning\-path\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> fish \-\-debug=iothread
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Available categories are listed by \fBfish \-\-print\-debug\-categories\fP\&. The \fB\-\-debug\fP option accepts a comma\-separated list of categories, and supports glob syntax.
The following command turns on debugging for \fIcomplete\fP, \fIhistory\fP, \fIhistory\-file\fP, and \fIprofile\-history\fP, as well as the default categories:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> fish \-\-debug=\(aqcomplete,*history*\(aq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Debug messages output to stderr by default. Note that if \fBfish_trace\fP \%<#\:envvar-fish_trace> is set, execution tracing also outputs to stderr by default. You can output to a file using the \fB\-\-debug\-output\fP option:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> fish \-\-debug=\(aqcomplete,*history*\(aq \-\-debug\-output=/tmp/fish.log \-\-init\-command=\(aqset fish_trace on\(aq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
These options can also be changed via the \fBFISH_DEBUG\fP \%<#\:envvar-FISH_DEBUG> and \fBFISH_DEBUG_OUTPUT\fP \%<#\:envvar-FISH_DEBUG_OUTPUT> variables.
The categories enabled via \fB\-\-debug\fP are \fIadded\fP to the ones enabled by $FISH_DEBUG, so they can be disabled by prefixing them with \fB\-\fP (\fBreader\-*,\-ast*\fP enables reader debugging and disables ast debugging).
.sp
The file given in \fB\-\-debug\-output\fP takes precedence over the file in \fBFISH_DEBUG_OUTPUT\fP \%<#\:envvar-FISH_DEBUG_OUTPUT>\&.

.fi
.sp
.SS Description
.sp
\fBfish_add_path\fP is a simple way to add more directories to fish\(aqs \fBPATH\fP \%<#\:envvar-PATH>\&. It does this by adding the directories either to \fBfish_user_paths\fP \%<#\:envvar-fish_user_paths> or directly to \fBPATH\fP \%<#\:envvar-PATH> (if the \fB\-\-path\fP switch is given).
.sp
It is (by default) safe to use \fBfish_add_path\fP in config.fish, or it can be used once, interactively, and the paths will stay in future because of universal variables \%<#\:variables-universal>\&. This is a \(dqdo what I mean\(dq style command \- it tries to do the right thing by default, and follow your lead on what you have already set up (e.g. by using a global \fBfish_user_paths\fP \%<#\:envvar-fish_user_paths> if you have that already). If you need more control, consider modifying the variable yourself.
.sp
Directories are normalized with realpath \%<>\&. Trailing slashes are ignored and relative paths are made absolute (but symlinks are not resolved). If a directory is already included, it is not added again and stays in the same place unless the \fB\-\-move\fP switch is given.
.sp
Directories are added in the order they are given, and they are prepended to the path unless \fB\-\-append\fP is given. If $fish_user_paths is used, that means they are last in $fish_user_paths, which is itself prepended to \fBPATH\fP \%<#\:envvar-PATH>, so they still stay ahead of the system paths. If the \fB\-\-path\fP option is used, the paths are appended/prepended to \fBPATH\fP \%<#\:envvar-PATH> directly, so this doesn\(aqt happen.
.sp
With \fB\-\-path\fP, because \fBPATH\fP \%<#\:envvar-PATH> must be a global variable instead of a universal one, the changes won\(aqt persist, so those calls need to be stored in config.fish \%<#\:configuration>\&. This also applies to \fBfish_user_paths\fP \%<#\:envvar-fish_user_paths> if you make it global (for instance by passing \fB\-\-global\fP).
.sp
If no directory is new, the variable (\fBfish_user_paths\fP \%<#\:envvar-fish_user_paths> or \fBPATH\fP \%<#\:envvar-PATH>) is not set again or otherwise modified, so variable handlers are not triggered.
.sp
If an argument is not an existing directory, \fBfish_add_path\fP ignores it.

.SS Description
.sp
\fBfish_config\fP is used to configure fish.
.sp
Without arguments or with the \fBbrowse\fP command it starts the web\-based configuration interface. The web interface allows you to view your functions, variables and history, and to make changes to your prompt and color configuration. It starts a local web server and opens a browser window. When you are finished, close the browser window and press the Enter key to terminate the configuration session.
.sp
If the \fBBROWSER\fP environment variable is set, it will be used as the name of the web browser to open instead of the system default.
.sp
With the \fBprompt\fP command \fBfish_config\fP can be used to view and choose a prompt from fish\(aqs sample prompts inside the terminal directly.
.sp
Available subcommands for the \fBprompt\fP command:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBchoose\fP loads a sample prompt in the current session.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBlist\fP lists the names of the available sample prompts.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBsave\fP saves the current prompt to a file (via funcsave \%<>).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBshow\fP shows what the given sample prompts (or all) would look like.

.SS Theme Files
.sp
\fBfish_config theme\fP and the theme selector in the web config tool load their themes from theme files. These are stored in the fish configuration directory, typically \fB~/.config/fish/themes\fP, with a .theme ending.
.sp
You can add your own theme by adding a file in that directory.

.sp
The two comments at the beginning are the name and background that the web config tool shows.
.sp
The other lines are just like \fBset variable value\fP, except that no expansions are allowed. Quotes are, but aren\(aqt necessary.
.sp
Any color variable fish knows about that the theme doesn\(aqt set will be set to empty when it is loaded, so the old theme is completely overwritten.
.sp
Other than that, .theme files can contain any variable with a name that matches the regular expression \fB\(aq^fish_(?:pager_)?color.*$\(aq\fP \- starts with \fBfish_\fP, an optional \fBpager_\fP, then \fBcolor\fP and then anything.

.sp
.SS Description
.sp
The \fBfish_delta\fP function tells you, at a glance, which of your functions and completions differ from the set that fish ships.
.sp
It does this by going through the relevant variables (\fBfish_function_path\fP \%<#\:envvar-fish_function_path> for functions and \fBfish_complete_path\fP \%<#\:envvar-fish_complete_path> for completions) and comparing the files against fish\(aqs default directories.
.sp
If any names are given, it will only compare files by those names (plus a \(dq.fish\(dq extension).
.sp
By default, it will also use \fBdiff\fP to display the difference between the files. If \fBdiff\fP is unavailable, it will skip it, but in that case it also cannot figure out if the files really differ.
.sp
The exit status is 1 if there was a difference and 2 for other errors, otherwise 0.

.sp
.SS Description
.sp
This command provides a way to produce option specifications suitable for use with the argparse \%<> command. You can, of course, write the option specifications by hand without using this command. But you might prefer to use this for the clarity it provides.
.sp
The following \fBargparse\fP options are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-s\fP or \fB\-\-short\fP \fIALPHANUM\fP
Takes a single letter or number that is used as the short flag in the option being defined. Either this option or the \fB\-\-long\fP option must be provided.
.TP
\fB\-l\fP or \fB\-\-long\fP \fILONG\-NAME\fP
Takes a string that is used as the long flag in the option being defined. This option is optional and has no default. If no long flag is defined then only the short flag will be allowed when parsing arguments using the option specification.
.TP
\fB\-\-long\-only\fP
Deprecated. The option being defined will only allow the long flag name to be used, even if the short flag is defined (i.e., \fB\-\-short\fP is specified).
.TP
\fB\-o\fP or \fB\-\-optional\-val\fP
The option being defined can take a value, but it is optional rather than required. If the option is seen more than once when parsing arguments, only the last value seen is saved. This means the resulting flag variable created by \fBargparse\fP will zero elements if no value was given with the option else it will have exactly one element.
.TP
\fB\-r\fP or \fB\-\-required\-val\fP
The option being defined requires a value. If the option is seen more than once when parsing arguments, only the last value seen is saved. This means the resulting flag variable created by \fBargparse\fP will have exactly one element.
.TP
\fB\-m\fP or \fB\-\-multiple\-vals\fP
The value of each instance of the option is accumulated. If \fB\-\-optional\-val\fP is provided, the value is optional, and an empty string is stored if no value is provided. Otherwise, the \fB\-\-requiured\-val\fP option is implied and each instance of the option requires a value. This means the resulting flag variable created by \fBargparse\fP will have one element for each instance of this option in the arguments, even for instances that did not provide a value.
.TP
\fB\-d\fP or \fB\-\-delete\fP
The option and any values will be deleted from the \fB$argv_opts\fP variables set by \fBargparse\fP
(as with other options, it will also be deleted from \fB$argv\fP).
.TP
\fB\-v\fP or \fB\-\-validate\fP \fICOMMAND\fP \fIOPTION...\fP
This option must be the last one, and requires one of \fB\-o\fP, \fB\-r\fP, or \fB\-m\fP\&. All the remaining arguments are interpreted a fish script to run to validate the value of the argument, see \fBargparse\fP documentation for more details. Note that the interpretation of \fICOMMAND\fP \fIOPTION...\fP is similar to \fBeval\fP, so you may need to quote or escape special characters \fItwice\fP if you want them to be interpreted literally when the validate script is run.
.TP

.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Description
.sp
The \fBfish_should_add_to_history\fP function is executed before fish adds a command to history, and its return status decides whether that is done.
.sp
If it returns 0, the command is stored in history, when it returns anything else, it is not. In the latter case the command can still be recalled for one command.
.sp
The first argument to \fBfish_should_add_to_history\fP is the commandline. History is added \fIbefore\fP a command is run, so e.g. \fBstatus\fP \%<#\:envvar-status> can\(aqt be checked. This is so commands that don\(aqt finish like exec \- execute command in current process \%<> and long\-running commands are available in new sessions immediately.
.sp
If \fBfish_should_add_to_history\fP doesn\(aqt exist, fish will save a command to history unless it starts with a space. If it does exist, this function takes over all of the duties, so commands starting with space are saved unless \fBfish_should_add_to_history\fP says otherwise.
.SS Example

The \fBfish_vcs_prompt\fP function displays information about the current version control system (VCS) repository, if any.
.sp
It calls out to VCS\-specific functions. The currently supported systems are:
.INDENT 0.0

fish_hg_prompt \%<>
.IP \(bu 2
fish_svn_prompt \%<>
.UNINDENT
.sp
If a VCS isn\(aqt installed, the respective function does nothing.
.sp
The Subversion prompt is disabled by default, because it\(aqs slow on large repositories. To enable it, modify \fBfish_vcs_prompt\fP to uncomment it. See funced \%<>\&.

.SS Description
.sp
\fBfor\fP is a loop construct. It will perform the commands specified by \fICOMMANDS\fP multiple times. On each iteration, the local variable specified by \fIVARNAME\fP is assigned a new value from \fIVALUES\fP\&. If \fIVALUES\fP is empty, \fICOMMANDS\fP will not be executed at all. The \fIVARNAME\fP is visible when the loop terminates and will contain the last value assigned to it. If \fIVARNAME\fP does not already exist it will be set in the local scope. For our purposes if the \fBfor\fP block is inside a function there must be a local variable with the same name. If the \fBfor\fP block is not nested inside a function then global and universal variables of the same name will be used if they exist.
.sp
Much like set \%<>, \fBfor\fP does not modify $status, but the evaluation of its subordinate commands can.
.sp
The \fB\-h\fP or \fB\-\-help\fP option displays help about using this command.
.SS Example

.fi
.sp
.SS Description
.sp
\fBfunced\fP provides an interface to edit the definition of the function \fINAME\fP\&.
.sp
If the \fB$VISUAL\fP environment variable is set, it will be used as the program to edit the function. If \fB$VISUAL\fP is unset but \fB$EDITOR\fP is set, that will be used. Otherwise, a built\-in editor will be used. Note that to enter a literal newline using the built\-in editor you should press \fBalt\fP\-\fBenter\fP\&. Pressing \fBenter\fP signals that you are done editing the function. This does not apply to an external editor like emacs or vim.
.sp
\fBfunced\fP will try to edit the original file that a function is defined in, which might include variable definitions or helper functions as well. If changes cannot be saved to the original file, a copy will be created in the user\(aqs function directory.
.sp
If there is no function called \fINAME\fP, a new function will be created with the specified name.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-e command\fP or \fB\-\-editor command\fP

.sp
.SS Description
.sp
\fBfuncsave\fP saves a function to a file in the fish configuration directory. This function will be automatically loaded \%<#\:syntax-function-autoloading> by current and future fish sessions. This can be useful to commit functions created interactively for permanent use.
.sp
If you have erased a function using functions \%<>\(aqs \fB\-\-erase\fP option, \fBfuncsave\fP will remove the saved function definition.
.sp
Because fish loads functions on\-demand, saved functions cannot serve as event handlers \%<#\:event> until they are run or otherwise sourced. To activate an event handler for every new shell, add the function to the configuration file \%<#\:configuration> instead of using \fBfuncsave\fP\&.
.sp
This is often used after funced \%<>, which opens the function in \fB$EDITOR\fP or \fB$VISUAL\fP and loads it into the current session afterwards.

\fBfunction\fP creates a new function \fINAME\fP with the body \fIBODY\fP\&.
.sp
A function is a list of commands that will be executed when the name of the function is given as a command.
.sp
The following options are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-a\fP \fINAMES\fP or \fB\-\-argument\-names\fP \fINAMES\fP
Assigns the value of successive command\-line arguments to the names given in \fINAMES\fP (separated by spaces). These are the same arguments given in \fBargv\fP \%<#\:envvar-argv>, and are still available there (unless \fB\-\-inherit\-variable argv\fP was used or one of the given \fINAMES\fP is \fBargv\fP). See also Argument Handling \%<#\:variables-argv>\&.
.TP
\fB\-d\fP \fIDESCRIPTION\fP or \fB\-\-description\fP \fIDESCRIPTION\fP
A description of what the function does, suitable as a completion description.
.TP
\fB\-w\fP \fIWRAPPED_COMMAND\fP or \fB\-\-wraps\fP \fIWRAPPED_COMMAND\fP
Inherit completions from the given \fIWRAPPED_COMMAND\fP\&.
This is used to say that this function completes like that command,
for example if you\(aqre creating an alias.
See the documentation for complete \%<> for more information.
If the wrapped command is the same as the function name, this will be ignored.
.TP
\fB\-e\fP \fIEVENT_NAME\fP or \fB\-\-on\-event\fP \fIEVENT_NAME\fP
Run this function when the specified named event is emitted. Fish internally generates named events, for example, when showing the prompt. Custom events can be emitted using the emit \%<> command.
.TP
\fB\-v\fP \fIVARIABLE_NAME\fP or \fB\-\-on\-variable\fP \fIVARIABLE_NAME\fP
Run this function when the variable \fIVARIABLE_NAME\fP changes value. Note that \fBfish\fP makes no guarantees on any particular timing or even that the function will be run for every single \fBset\fP\&. Rather it will be run when the variable has been set at least once, possibly skipping some values or being run when the variable has been set to the same value (except for universal variables set in other shells \- only changes in the value will be picked up for those).
.TP
\fB\-j\fP \fIPID\fP or \fB\-\-on\-job\-exit\fP \fIPID\fP
Run this function when the job containing a child process with the given process ID \fIPID\fP exits. Instead of a PID, the string \(aqcaller\(aq can be specified. This is only allowed when in a command substitution, and will result in the handler being triggered by the exit of the job which created this command substitution.
This will not trigger for disowned \%<> jobs.
.TP
\fB\-p\fP \fIPID\fP or \fB\-\-on\-process\-exit\fP \fIPID\fP
Run this function when the fish child process with process ID PID exits. Instead of a PID, for backward compatibility, \(dq\fB%self\fP\(dq can be specified as an alias for \fB$fish_pid\fP, and the function will be run when the current fish instance exits.
This will not trigger for disowned \%<> jobs.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP \fISIGSPEC\fP or \fB\-\-on\-signal\fP \fISIGSPEC\fP
Run this function when the signal \fBSIGSPEC\fP is delivered. \fBSIGSPEC\fP can be a signal number, or the signal name, such as \fBSIGHUP\fP (or just \fBHUP\fP). Note that the signal must have been delivered to \fBfish\fP; for example, \fBctrl\fP\-\fBc\fP sends \fBSIGINT\fP to the foreground process group, which will not be \fBfish\fP if you are running another command at the time. Observing a signal will prevent fish from exiting in response to that signal.
.TP
\fB\-S\fP or \fB\-\-no\-scope\-shadowing\fP
Allows the function to access the variables of calling functions. Normally, any variables inside the function that have the same name as variables from the calling function are \(dqshadowed\(dq, and their contents are independent of the calling function.
.sp
It\(aqs important to note that this does not capture referenced variables or the scope at the time of function declaration! At this time, fish does not have any concept of closures, and variable lifetimes are never extended. In other words, by using \fB\-\-no\-scope\-shadowing\fP the scope of the function each time it is run is shared with the scope it was \fIcalled\fP from rather than the scope it was \fIdefined\fP in.
.TP
\fB\-V\fP or \fB\-\-inherit\-variable NAME\fP
Snapshots the value of the variable \fBNAME\fP and defines a local variable with that same name and value when the function is defined. This is similar to a closure in other languages like Python but a bit different. Note the word \(dqsnapshot\(dq in the first sentence. If you change the value of the variable after defining the function, even if you do so in the same scope (typically another function) the new value will not be used by the function you just created using this option. See the \fBfunction notify\fP example below for how this might be used.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The event handler switches (\fBon\-event\fP, \fBon\-variable\fP, \fBon\-job\-exit\fP, \fBon\-process\-exit\fP and \fBon\-signal\fP) cause a function to run automatically at specific events. New named events for \fB\-\-on\-event\fP can be fired using the emit \%<> builtin. Fish already generates a few events, see Event handlers \%<#\:event> for more.
.sp
Functions names cannot be reserved words. These are elements of fish syntax or builtin commands which are essential for the operations of the shell. Current reserved words are \fB[\fP, \fB_\fP, \fBand\fP, \fBargparse\fP, \fBbegin\fP, \fBbreak\fP, \fBbuiltin\fP, \fBcase\fP, \fBcommand\fP, \fBcontinue\fP, \fBelse\fP, \fBend\fP, \fBeval\fP, \fBexec\fP, \fBfor\fP, \fBfunction\fP, \fBif\fP, \fBnot\fP, \fBor\fP, \fBread\fP, \fBreturn\fP, \fBset\fP, \fBstatus\fP, \fBstring\fP, \fBswitch\fP, \fBtest\fP, \fBtime\fP, and \fBwhile\fP\&.

\fBhistory\fP is used to search, delete, and otherwise manipulate the history of interactive commands \%<#\:history-search>\&.
.sp
The following operations (sub\-commands) are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fBsearch\fP
Returns history items matching the search string. If no search string is provided it returns all history items. This is the default operation if no other operation is specified. You only have to explicitly say \fBhistory search\fP if you wish to search for one of the subcommands. The \fB\-\-contains\fP search option will be used if you don\(aqt specify a different search option. Entries are ordered newest to oldest unless you use the \fB\-\-reverse\fP flag. If stdout is attached to a tty the output will be piped through your pager by the history function. The history builtin writes the results to stdout.
.TP
\fBdelete\fP
Deletes history items. The \fB\-\-contains\fP search option will be used if you don\(aqt specify a different search option. If you don\(aqt specify \fB\-\-exact\fP a prompt will be displayed before any items are deleted asking you which entries are to be deleted. You can enter the word \(dqall\(dq to delete all matching entries. You can enter a single ID (the number in square brackets) to delete just that single entry. You can enter more than one ID, or an ID range separated by a space to delete multiple entries. Press [enter] to not delete anything. Note that the interactive delete behavior is a feature of the history function. The history builtin only supports \fB\-\-exact \-\-case\-sensitive\fP deletion.
.TP
\fBmerge\fP
Immediately incorporates history changes from other sessions. Ordinarily \fBfish\fP ignores history changes from sessions started after the current one. This command applies those changes immediately.
.TP
\fBsave\fP
Immediately writes all changes to the history file. The shell automatically saves the history file; this option is provided for internal use and should not normally need to be used by the user.
.TP
\fBclear\fP
Clears the history file. A prompt is displayed before the history is erased asking you to confirm you really want to clear all history unless \fBbuiltin history\fP is used.
.TP
\fBclear\-session\fP
Clears the history file from all activity of the current session. Note: If \fBhistory merge\fP or \fBbuiltin history merge\fP is run in a session, only the history after this will be erased.
.TP
\fBappend\fP
Appends commands to the history without needing to execute them.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The following options are available:
.sp
These flags can appear before or immediately after one of the sub\-commands listed above.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-C\fP or \fB\-\-case\-sensitive\fP
Does a case\-sensitive search. The default is case\-insensitive.
.TP
\fB\-c\fP or \fB\-\-contains\fP
Searches items in the history that contain the specified text string. This is the default for the \fB\-\-search\fP flag. This is not currently supported by the \fBdelete\fP subcommand.
.TP
\fB\-e\fP or \fB\-\-exact\fP
Searches or deletes items in the history that exactly match the specified text string. This is the default for the \fBdelete\fP subcommand. Note that the match is case\-insensitive by default. If you really want an exact match, including letter case, you must use the \fB\-C\fP or \fB\-\-case\-sensitive\fP flag.
.TP
\fB\-p\fP or \fB\-\-prefix\fP
Searches items in the history that begin with the specified text string. This is not currently supported by the \fBdelete\fP subcommand.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-t\fP or \fB\-\-show\-time\fP
Prepends each history entry with the date and time the entry was recorded. By default it uses the strftime format \fB# %c%n\fP\&. You can specify another format; e.g., \fB\-\-show\-time=\(dq%Y\-%m\-%d %H:%M:%S \(dq\fP or \fB\-\-show\-time=\(dq%a%I%p\(dq\fP\&. The short option, \fB\-t\fP, doesn\(aqt accept a strftime format string; it only uses the default format. Any strftime format is allowed, including \fB%s\fP to get the raw UNIX seconds since the epoch.

By default interactive commands are logged to \fB$XDG_DATA_HOME/fish/fish_history\fP (typically \fB~/.local/share/fish/fish_history\fP).
.sp
You can set the \fBfish_history\fP variable to another name for the current shell session. The default value (when the variable is unset) is \fBfish\fP which corresponds to \fB$XDG_DATA_HOME/fish/fish_history\fP\&. If you set it to e.g. \fBfun\fP, the history would be written to \fB$XDG_DATA_HOME/fish/fun_history\fP\&. An empty string means history will not be stored at all. This is similar to the private session features in web browsers.
.sp
You can change \fBfish_history\fP at any time (by using \fBset \-x fish_history \(dqsession_name\(dq\fP) and it will take effect right away. If you set it to \fB\(dqdefault\(dq\fP, it will use the default session name (which is \fB\(dqfish\(dq\fP).
.sp
Other shells such as bash and zsh use a variable named \fBHISTFILE\fP for a similar purpose. Fish uses a different name to avoid conflicts and signal that the behavior is different (session name instead of a file path). Also, if you set the var to anything other than \fBfish\fP or \fBdefault\fP it will inhibit importing the bash history. That\(aqs because the most common use case for this feature is to avoid leaking private or sensitive history when giving a presentation.

.fi
.sp
.SS Description
.sp
\fBmath\fP performs mathematical calculations.
It supports simple operations such as addition, subtraction, and so on, as well as functions like \fBabs()\fP, \fBsqrt()\fP and \fBln()\fP\&.
.sp
By default, the output shows up to 6 decimal places.
To change the number of decimal places, use the \fB\-\-scale\fP option, including \fB\-\-scale=0\fP for integer output.
.sp
Keep in mind that parameter expansion happens before expressions are evaluated.
This can be very useful in order to perform calculations involving shell variables or the output of command substitutions, but it also means that parenthesis (\fB()\fP) and the asterisk (\fB*\fP) glob character have to be escaped or quoted.
\fBx\fP can also be used to denote multiplication, but it needs to be followed by whitespace to distinguish it from hexadecimal numbers.
.sp
Parentheses for functions are optional \- \fBmath sin pi\fP prints \fB0\fP\&.
However, a comma will bind to the inner function, so \fBmath pow sin 3, 5\fP is an error because it tries to give \fBsin\fP the arguments \fB3\fP and \fB5\fP\&.
When in doubt, use parentheses.
.sp
\fBmath\fP ignores whitespace between arguments and takes its input as multiple arguments (internally joined with a space), so \fBmath 2 +2\fP and \fBmath \(dq2 +    2\(dq\fP work the same.
\fBmath 2 2\fP is an error.
.sp
The following options are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-s\fP \fIN\fP or \fB\-\-scale\fP \fIN\fP
Sets the scale of the result.
\fBN\fP must be an integer or the word \(dqmax\(dq for the maximum scale.
A scale of zero causes results to be truncated by default. Any non\-integer component is thrown away.
So \fB3/2\fP returns \fB1\fP by default, rather than \fB2\fP which \fB1.5\fP would normally round to.
This is for compatibility with \fBbc\fP which was the basis for this command prior to fish 3.0.0.
Scale values greater than zero causes the result to be rounded using the usual rules to the specified number of decimal places.
.TP
\fB\-b\fP \fIBASE\fP or \fB\-\-base\fP \fIBASE\fP
Sets the numeric base used for output (\fBmath\fP always understands hexadecimal numbers as input).
It currently understands \(dqhex\(dq or \(dq16\(dq for hexadecimal and \(dqoctal\(dq or \(dq8\(dq for octal and implies a scale of 0 (other scales cause an error), so it will truncate the result down to an integer.
This might change in the future.
Hex numbers will be printed with a \fB0x\fP prefix.
Octal numbers will have a prefix of \fB0\fP but aren\(aqt understood by \fBmath\fP as input.
.TP
\fB\-m\fP \fIMODE\fP or \fB\-\-scale\-mode\fP \fIMODE\fP
Sets scale behavior.
The \fBMODE\fP can be \fBtruncate\fP, \fBround\fP, \fBfloor\fP, \fBceiling\fP\&.
The default value of scale mode is \fBround\fP with non zero scale and \fBtruncate\fP with zero scale.

.SS Syntax
.sp
\fBmath\fP knows some operators, constants, functions and can (obviously) read numbers.
.sp
For numbers, \fB\&.\fP is always the radix character regardless of locale \- \fB2.5\fP, not \fB2,5\fP\&.
Scientific notation (\fB10e5\fP) and hexadecimal (\fB0xFF\fP) are also available.
.sp
\fBmath\fP allows you to use underscores as visual separators for digit grouping. For example, you can write \fB1_000_000\fP, \fB0x_89_AB_CD_EF\fP, and \fB1.234_567_e89\fP\&.
.SS Operators

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB+\fP
for addition
.TP
.B \fB\-\fP
for subtraction
.TP
.B \fB*\fP or \fBx\fP
for multiplication. \fB*\fP is the glob character and needs to be quoted or escaped, \fBx\fP needs to be followed by whitespace or it looks like \fB0x\fP hexadecimal notation.
.TP
.B \fB/\fP
for division
.TP
.B \fB^\fP
for exponentiation
.TP
.B \fB%\fP
for modulo
.TP
.B \fB(\fP or \fB)\fP

Fish 1.x and 2.x releases relied on the \fBbc\fP command for handling \fBmath\fP expressions. Starting with fish 3.0.0 fish uses the tinyexpr library and evaluates the expression without the involvement of any external commands.
.sp
You don\(aqt need to use \fB\-\-\fP before the expression, even if it begins with a minus sign which might otherwise be interpreted as an invalid option. If you do insert \fB\-\-\fP before the expression, it will cause option scanning to stop just like for every other command and it won\(aqt be part of the expression.

When a path starts with \fB\-\fP, \fBpath filter\fP and \fBpath normalize\fP will prepend \fB\&./\fP on output to avoid it being interpreted as an option otherwise, so it\(aqs safe to pass path\(aqs output to other commands that can handle relative paths.
.sp
All subcommands accept a \fB\-q\fP or \fB\-\-quiet\fP switch, which suppresses the usual output but exits with the documented status. In this case these commands will quit early, without reading all of the available input.
.sp
All subcommands also accept a \fB\-Z\fP or \fB\-\-null\-out\fP switch, which makes them print output separated with NUL instead of newlines. This is for further processing, e.g. passing to another \fBpath\fP, or \fBxargs \-0\fP\&. This is not recommended when the output goes to the terminal or a command substitution.
.sp
All subcommands also accept a \fB\-z\fP or \fB\-\-null\-in\fP switch, which makes them accept arguments from stdin separated with NULL\-bytes. Since Unix paths can\(aqt contain NULL, that makes it possible to handle all possible paths and read input from e.g. \fBfind \-print0\fP\&. If arguments are given on the commandline this has no effect. This should mostly be unnecessary since \fBpath\fP automatically starts splitting on NULL if one appears in the first PATH_MAX bytes, PATH_MAX being the operating system\(aqs maximum length for a path plus a NULL byte.
.sp
Some subcommands operate on the paths as strings and so work on nonexistent paths, while others need to access the paths themselves and so filter out nonexistent paths.
.sp
The following subcommands are available.

\fBpath basename\fP returns the last path component of the given path, by removing the directory prefix and removing trailing slashes. In other words, it is the part that is not the dirname. For files you might call it the \(dqfilename\(dq.
.sp
If the \fB\-E\fP or \fB\-\-\-no\-extension\fP option is used and the base name contained a period, the path is returned with the extension (or the last extension) removed, i.e. the \(dqfilename\(dq without an extension (akin to calling \fBpath change\-extension \(dq\(dq (path basename $path)\fP).

\fBpath filter\fP returns all of the given paths that match the given checks. In all cases, the paths need to exist, nonexistent paths are always filtered.
.sp
The available filters are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-t\fP or \fB\-\-type\fP with the options: \(dqdir\(dq, \(dqfile\(dq, \(dqlink\(dq, \(dqblock\(dq, \(dqchar\(dq, \(dqfifo\(dq and \(dqsocket\(dq, in which case the path needs to be a directory, file, link, block device, character device, named pipe or socket, respectively.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-d\fP, \fB\-f\fP and \fB\-l\fP are short for \fB\-\-type=dir\fP, \fB\-\-type=file\fP and \fB\-\-type=link\fP, respectively. There are no shortcuts for the other types.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-p\fP or \fB\-\-perm\fP with the options: \(dqread\(dq, \(dqwrite\(dq, and \(dqexec\(dq, as well as \(dqsuid\(dq, \(dqsgid\(dq, \(dquser\(dq (referring to the path owner) and \(dqgroup\(dq (referring to the path\(aqs group), in which case the path needs to have all of the given permissions for the current user.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-r\fP, \fB\-w\fP and \fB\-x\fP are short for \fB\-\-perm=read\fP, \fB\-\-perm=write\fP and \fB\-\-perm=exec\fP, respectively. There are no shortcuts for the other permissions.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that the path needs to be \fIany\fP of the given types, but have \fIall\fP of the given permissions. This is because having a path that is both writable and executable makes sense, but having a path that is both a directory and a file doesn\(aqt. Links will count as the type of the linked\-to file, so links to files count as files, links to directories count as directories.
.sp
The filter options can either be given as multiple options, or comma\-separated \- \fBpath filter \-t dir,file\fP or \fBpath filter \-\-type dir \-\-type file\fP are equivalent.
.sp
With \fB\-\-invert\fP, the meaning of the filtering is inverted \- any path that wouldn\(aqt pass (including by not existing) passes, and any path that would pass fails.
.sp
When a path starts with \fB\-\fP, \fBpath filter\fP will prepend \fB\&./\fP to avoid it being interpreted as an option otherwise.
.sp
It returns 0 if at least one path passed the filter.
.sp
With \fB\-\-all\fP, return status 0 (true) if all paths pass the filter, and status 1 (false) if any path fails. This is equivalent to \fBnot path filter \-v\fP\&. It produces no output, only a status.
.sp
When \fB\-\-all\fP combined with \fB\-\-invert\fP, it returns status 0 (true) if all paths fail the filter and status 1 (false) if any path passes.
.sp
\fBpath is\fP is shorthand for \fBpath filter \-q\fP, i.e. just checking without producing output, see The is subcommand\&.

With \fB\-\-relative\fP (or \fB\-R\fP), it prints the number of seconds since the modification time. It only reads the current time once at start, so in case multiple paths are given the times are all relative to the \fIstart\fP of \fBpath mtime \-R\fP running.

\fBpath normalize\fP returns the normalized versions of all paths. That means it squashes duplicate \(dq/\(dq, collapses \(dq../\(dq with earlier components and removes \(dq.\(dq components.
.sp
Unlike \fBrealpath\fP or \fBpath resolve\fP, it does not make the paths absolute. It also does not resolve any symlinks. As such it can operate on non\-existent paths.
.sp
Because it operates on paths as strings and doesn\(aqt resolve symlinks, it works sort of like \fBpwd \-L\fP and \fBcd\fP\&. E.g. \fBpath normalize link/..\fP will return \fB\&.\fP, just like \fBcd link; cd ..\fP would return to the current directory. For a physical view of the filesystem, see \fBpath resolve\fP\&.
.sp
Leading \(dq./\(dq components are usually removed. But when a path starts with \fB\-\fP, \fBpath normalize\fP will add it instead to avoid confusion with options.

\fBpath resolve\fP returns the normalized, physical and absolute versions of all paths. That means it resolves symlinks and does what \fBpath normalize\fP does: it squashes duplicate \(dq/\(dq, collapses \(dq../\(dq with earlier components and removes \(dq.\(dq components. Then it turns that path into the absolute path starting from the filesystem root \(dq/\(dq.
.sp
It is similar to \fBrealpath\fP, as it creates the \(dqreal\(dq, canonical version of the path. However, for paths that can\(aqt be resolved, e.g. if they don\(aqt exist or form a symlink loop, it will resolve as far as it can and normalize the rest.
.sp
Because it resolves symlinks, it works sort of like \fBpwd \-P\fP\&. E.g. \fBpath resolve link/..\fP will return the parent directory of what the link points to, just like \fBcd link; cd (pwd \-P)/..\fP would go to it. For a logical view of the filesystem, see \fBpath normalize\fP\&.

\fBprintf\fP uses the format string \fIFORMAT\fP to print the \fIARGUMENT\fP arguments. This means that it takes format specifiers in the format string and replaces each with an argument.

.SS Errors and Return Status
.sp
If the given argument doesn\(aqt work for the given format (like when you try to convert a number like 3.141592 to an integer), printf prints an error, to stderr. printf will then also return non\-zero, but will still try to print as much as it can.
.sp
It will also return non\-zero if no argument at all was given, in which case it will print nothing.

This printf has been imported from the printf in GNU Coreutils version 6.9. If you would like to use a newer version of printf, for example the one shipped with your OS, try \fBcommand printf\fP\&.

.SS Description
.sp
\fBprompt_pwd\fP is a function to print the current working directory in a way suitable for prompts. It will replace the home directory with \(dq~\(dq and shorten every path component but the last to a default of one character.
.sp
To change the number of characters per path component, pass \fB\-\-dir\-length=\fP or set \fBfish_prompt_pwd_dir_length\fP to the number of characters. Setting it to 0 or an invalid value will disable shortening entirely. This defaults to 1.
.sp
To keep some components unshortened, pass \fB\-\-full\-length\-dirs=\fP or set \fBfish_prompt_pwd_full_dirs\fP to the number of components. This defaults to 1, keeping the last component.

.SS Description
.sp
Some shells (e.g., ksh, bash) feature a syntax that is a mix between command substitution and piping, called process substitution. It is used to send the output of a command into the calling command, much like command substitution, but with the difference that the output is not sent through commandline arguments but through a named pipe, with the filename of the named pipe sent as an argument to the calling program. \fBpsub\fP combined with a regular command substitution provides the same functionality.
.sp
The following options are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-f\fP or \fB\-\-file\fP
Use a regular file instead of a named pipe to communicate with the calling process. This will cause \fBpsub\fP to be significantly slower when large amounts of data are involved, but has the advantage that the reading process can seek in the stream. This is the default.
.TP
\fB\-F\fP or \fB\-\-fifo\fP
Use a named pipe rather than a file. You should only use this if the command produces no more than 8 KiB of output. The limit on the amount of data a FIFO can buffer varies with the OS but is typically 8 KiB, 16 KiB or 64 KiB. If you use this option and the command on the left of the psub pipeline produces more output a deadlock is likely to occur.

.SS Synopsis

\fBread\fP [\fIOPTIONS\fP] [\fIVARIABLE\fP \&...]
.fi
.sp
.SS Description
.sp
NOTE: This page documents the fish builtin \fBread\fP\&.
To see the documentation on any non\-fish versions, use \fBcommand man read\fP\&.
.sp
\fBread\fP reads from standard input and stores the result in shell variables. In an alternative mode, it can also print to its own standard output, for example for use in command substitutions.
.sp
By default, \fBread\fP reads a single line and splits it into variables on spaces or tabs. Alternatively, a null character or a maximum number of characters can be used to terminate the input, and other delimiters can be given.
.sp
Unlike other shells, there is no default variable (such as \fBREPLY\fP) for storing the result \- instead, it is printed on standard output.
.sp
When \fBread\fP reaches the end\-of\-file (EOF) instead of the terminator, the exit status is set to 1.
Otherwise, it is set to 0.
.sp
If \fBread\fP sets a variable and you don\(aqt specify a scope, it will use the same rules that set \- display and change shell variables \%<> does \- if the variable exists, it will use it (in the lowest scope). If it doesn\(aqt, it will use an unexported function\-scoped variable.
.sp
The following options, like the corresponding ones in set \- display and change shell variables \%<>, control variable scope or attributes:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-U\fP or \fB\-\-universal\fP
Sets a universal variable.
The variable will be immediately available to all the user\(aqs \fBfish\fP instances on the machine, and will be persisted across restarts of the shell.
.TP
\fB\-f\fP or \fB\-\-function\fP
Sets a variable scoped to the executing function.
It is erased when the function ends.
.TP
\fB\-l\fP or \fB\-\-local\fP
Sets a locally\-scoped variable in this block.
It is erased when the block ends.
Outside of a block, this is the same as \fB\-\-function\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-g\fP or \fB\-\-global\fP
Sets a globally\-scoped variable.
Global variables are available to all functions running in the same shell.
They can be modified or erased.
.TP
\fB\-u\fP or \fB\-\-unexport\fP
Prevents the variables from being exported to child processes (default behaviour).
.TP
\fB\-x\fP or \fB\-\-export\fP

.UNINDENT
.sp
The following options control the interactive mode:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-c\fP \fICMD\fP or \fB\-\-command\fP \fICMD\fP

.TP
\fB\-s\fP or \fB\-\-silent\fP
Masks characters written to the terminal, replacing them with asterisks. This is useful for reading things like passwords or other sensitive information.
.TP
\fB\-p\fP or \fB\-\-prompt\fP \fIPROMPT_CMD\fP
Uses the output of the shell command \fIPROMPT_CMD\fP as the prompt for the interactive mode. The default prompt command is \fBset_color green; echo \-n read; set_color normal; echo \-n \(dq> \(dq\fP
.TP
\fB\-P\fP or \fB\-\-prompt\-str\fP \fIPROMPT_STR\fP
Uses the literal \fIPROMPT_STR\fP as the prompt for the interactive mode.
.TP
\fB\-R\fP or \fB\-\-right\-prompt\fP \fIRIGHT_PROMPT_CMD\fP
Uses the output of the shell command \fIRIGHT_PROMPT_CMD\fP as the right prompt for the interactive mode. There is no default right prompt command.
.TP
\fB\-S\fP or \fB\-\-shell\fP
Enables syntax highlighting, tab completions and command termination suitable for entering shellscript code in the interactive mode. NOTE: Prior to fish 3.0, the short opt for \fB\-\-shell\fP was \fB\-s\fP, but it has been changed for compatibility with bash\(aqs \fB\-s\fP short opt for \fB\-\-silent\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The following options control how much is read and how it is stored:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-d\fP or \fB\-\-delimiter\fP \fIDELIMITER\fP
Splits on \fIDELIMITER\fP\&. \fIDELIMITER\fP will be used as an entire string to split on, not a set of characters.
.TP
\fB\-n\fP or \fB\-\-nchars\fP \fINCHARS\fP
Makes \fBread\fP return after reading \fINCHARS\fP characters or the end of the line, whichever comes first.
.TP
\fB\-t\fP, \fB\-\-tokenize\fP or \fB\-\-tokenize\-raw\fP
Causes read to split the input into variables by the shell\(aqs tokenization rules.
This means it will honor quotes and escaping.
This option is of course incompatible with other options to control splitting like \fB\-\-delimiter\fP and does not honor \fBIFS\fP \%<#\:envvar-IFS> (like fish\(aqs tokenizer).
The \fB\-t\fP \-or \fB\-\-tokenize\fP variants perform quote removal, so e.g. \fBa\e b\fP is stored as \fBa b\fP\&.
However variables and command substitutions are not expanded.
.TP
\fB\-a\fP or \fB\-\-list\fP
Stores the result as a list in a single variable. This option is also available as \fB\-\-array\fP for backwards compatibility.
.TP
\fB\-z\fP or \fB\-\-null\fP
Marks the end of the line with the NUL character, instead of newline. This also disables interactive mode.
.TP
\fB\-L\fP or \fB\-\-line\fP
Reads each line into successive variables, and stops after each variable has been filled. This cannot be combined with the \fB\-\-delimiter\fP option.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Without the \fB\-\-line\fP option, \fBread\fP reads a single line of input from standard input, breaks it into tokens, and then assigns one token to each variable specified in \fIVARIABLES\fP\&. If there are more tokens than variables, the complete remainder is assigned to the last variable.
.sp
If no option to determine how to split like \fB\-\-delimiter\fP, \fB\-\-line\fP or \fB\-\-tokenize\fP is given, the variable \fBIFS\fP is used as a list of characters to split on. Relying on the use of \fBIFS\fP is deprecated and this behaviour will be removed in future versions. The default value of \fBIFS\fP contains space, tab and newline characters. As a special case, if \fBIFS\fP is set to the empty string, each character of the input is considered a separate token.
.sp
With the \fB\-\-line\fP option, \fBread\fP reads a line of input from standard input into each provided variable, stopping when each variable has been filled. The line is not tokenized.
.sp
If no variable names are provided, \fBread\fP enters a special case that provides redirection from standard input to standard output, useful for command substitution. For instance, the fish shell command below can be used to read a password from the console instead of hardcoding it in the command itself, which prevents it from showing up in fish\(aqs history:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
mysql \-uuser \-p(read)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When running in this mode, \fBread\fP does not split the input in any way and text is redirected to standard output without any further processing or manipulation.
.sp
If \fB\-l\fP or \fB\-\-list\fP is provided, only one variable name is allowed and the tokens are stored as a list in this variable.
.sp
In order to protect the shell from consuming too many system resources, \fBread\fP will only consume a
maximum of 100 MiB (104857600 bytes); if the terminator is not reached before this limit then \fIVARIABLE\fP
is set to empty and the exit status is set to 122. This limit can be altered with the
\fBfish_read_limit\fP \%<#\:envvar-fish_read_limit> variable. If set to 0 (zero), the limit is removed.
.SS Example
.sp
\fBread\fP has a few separate uses.

With \fB\-\-show\fP, \fBset\fP will describe the given variable names, explaining how they have been defined \- in which scope with which values and options.
.sp
The following options control variable scope:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-U\fP or \fB\-\-universal\fP
Sets a universal variable.
The variable will be immediately available to all the user\(aqs \fBfish\fP instances on the machine, and will be persisted across restarts of the shell.
.TP
\fB\-f\fP or \fB\-\-function\fP
Sets a variable scoped to the executing function.
It is erased when the function ends.
.TP
\fB\-l\fP or \fB\-\-local\fP
Sets a locally\-scoped variable in this block.
It is erased when the block ends.
Outside of a block, this is the same as \fB\-\-function\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-g\fP or \fB\-\-global\fP
Sets a globally\-scoped variable.
Global variables are available to all functions running in the same shell.
They can be modified or erased.
.UNINDENT
.sp
These options modify how variables operate:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-\-export\fP or \fB\-x\fP
Causes the specified shell variable to be exported to child processes (making it an \(dqenvironment variable\(dq).
.TP
\fB\-\-unexport\fP or \fB\-u\fP
Causes the specified shell variable to NOT be exported to child processes.
.TP
\fB\-\-path\fP
Treat specified variable as a path variable \%<#\:variables-path>; variable will be split on colons (\fB:\fP) and will be displayed joined by colons when quoted (\fBecho \(dq$PATH\(dq\fP) or exported.
.TP
\fB\-\-unpath\fP
Causes variable to no longer be treated as a path variable \%<#\:variables-path>\&.
Note: variables ending in \(dqPATH\(dq are automatically path variables.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Further options:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-a\fP or \fB\-\-append\fP \fINAME\fP \fIVALUE\fP ...
Appends \fIVALUES\fP to the current set of values for variable \fBNAME\fP\&.
Can be used with \fB\-\-prepend\fP to both append and prepend at the same time.
This cannot be used when assigning to a variable slice.
.TP
\fB\-p\fP or \fB\-\-prepend\fP \fINAME\fP \fIVALUE\fP ...
Prepends \fIVALUES\fP to the current set of values for variable \fBNAME\fP\&.
This can be used with \fB\-\-append\fP to both append and prepend at the same time.
This cannot be used when assigning to a variable slice.
.TP
\fB\-e\fP or \fB\-\-erase\fP \fINAME\fP[\fIINDEX\fP]
Causes the specified shell variables to be erased.
Supports erasing from multiple scopes at once.
Individual items in a variable at \fIINDEX\fP in brackets can be specified.
.TP
\fB\-q\fP or \fB\-\-query\fP \fINAME\fP[\fIINDEX\fP]
Test if the specified variable names are defined.
If an \fIINDEX\fP is provided, check for items at that slot.
Does not output anything, but the shell status is set to the number of variables specified that were not defined, up to a maximum of 255.
If no variable was given, it also returns 255.
.TP
\fB\-n\fP or \fB\-\-names\fP
List only the names of all defined variables, not their value.
The names are guaranteed to be sorted.
.TP
\fB\-S\fP or \fB\-\-show\fP
Shows information about the given variables.
If no variable names are given then all variables are shown in sorted order.
It shows the scopes the given variables are set in, along with the values in each and whether or not it is exported.
No other flags can be used with this option.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-event\fP
Don\(aqt generate a variable change event when setting or erasing a variable.
We recommend using this carefully because the event handlers are usually set up for a reason.
Possible uses include modifying the variable inside a variable handler.
.TP
\fB\-L\fP or \fB\-\-long\fP
Do not abbreviate long values when printing set variables.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP or \fB\-\-help\fP
Displays help about using this command.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If a variable is set to more than one value, the variable will be a list with the specified elements.
If a variable is set to zero elements, it will become a list with zero elements.
.sp
If the variable name is one or more list elements, such as \fBPATH[1 3 7]\fP, only those list elements specified will be changed.
If you specify a negative index when expanding or assigning to a list variable, the index will be calculated from the end of the list.
For example, the index \-1 means the last index of a list.
.sp
The scoping rules when creating or updating a variable are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Variables may be explicitly set as universal, global, function, or local.
Variables with the same name but in a different scope will not be changed.
.IP \(bu 2
If the scope of a variable is not explicitly set \fIbut a variable by that name has been previously defined\fP, the scope of the existing variable is used.
If the variable is already defined in multiple scopes, the variable with the narrowest scope will be updated.
.IP \(bu 2
If a variable\(aqs scope is not explicitly set and there is no existing variable by that name, the variable will be local to the currently executing function.
Note that this is different from using the \fB\-l\fP or \fB\-\-local\fP flag, in which case the variable will be local to the most\-inner currently executing block, while without them the variable will be local to the function as a whole.
If no function is executing, the variable will be set in the global scope.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The exporting rules when creating or updating a variable are identical to the scoping rules for variables:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Variables may be explicitly set to either exported or not exported.
When an exported variable goes out of scope, it is unexported.
.IP \(bu 2
If a variable is not explicitly set to be exported or not exported, but has been previously defined, the previous exporting rule for the variable is kept.
.IP \(bu 2
If a variable is not explicitly set to be either exported or unexported and has never before been defined, the variable will not be exported.
.UNINDENT
.sp
In query mode, the scope to be examined can be specified.
Whether the variable has to be a path variable or exported can also be specified.
.sp
In erase mode, if variable indices are specified, only the specified slices of the list variable will be erased.
.sp
\fBset\fP requires all options to come before any other arguments.
For example, \fBset flags \-l\fP will have the effect of setting the value of the variable \fBflags\fP to \(aq\-l\(aq, not making the variable local.
.SS Exit status
.sp
In assignment mode, \fBset\fP does not modify the exit status, but passes along whatever \fBstatus\fP \%<#\:envvar-status> was set, including by command substitutions.
This allows capturing the output and exit status of a subcommand, like in \fBif set output (command)\fP\&.
.sp
In query mode, the exit status is the number of variables that were not found.
.sp
In erase mode, \fBset\fP exits with a zero exit status in case of success, with a non\-zero exit status if the commandline was invalid, if any of the variables did not exist or was a special read\-only variable \%<#\:variables-special>\&.

.SS Description
.sp
\fBset_color\fP is used to control the color and styling of text in the terminal. \fIVALUE\fP describes that styling. \fIVALUE\fP can be a reserved color name like \fBred\fP or an RGB color value given as 3 or 6 hexadecimal digits (\(dqF27\(dq or \(dqFF2277\(dq). A special keyword \fBnormal\fP resets text formatting to terminal defaults.

The \fIbr\fP\- (as in \(aqbright\(aq) forms are full\-brightness variants of the 8 standard\-brightness colors on many terminals. \fBbrblack\fP has higher brightness than \fBblack\fP \- towards gray.
.sp
An RGB value with three or six hex digits, such as A0FF33 or f2f can be used.
A three digit value is equivalent to specifying each digit twice; e.g., \fBset_color 2BC\fP is the same as \fBset_color 22BBCC\fP\&.
Hexadecimal RGB values can be in lower or uppercase.
.sp
If \fBfish_term24bit\fP \%<#\:envvar-fish_term24bit> is set to 0, fish will translate RGB values to the nearest color on the 256\-color palette.
If \fBfish_term256\fP \%<#\:envvar-fish_term256> is also set to 0, fish will translate them to the 16\-color palette instead.
Fish launched as \fBfish \-d term_support\fP will include diagnostic messages that indicate the color support mode in use.
.sp
If multiple colors are specified, fish prefers the first RGB one.
However if \fBfish_term256\fP \%<#\:envvar-fish_term256> is set to 0, fish prefers the first named color specified.
.sp
The following options are available:
.INDENT 0.0

.IP 1. 3
Using \fBset_color normal\fP will reset all colors and modes to the terminal\(aqs default.
.IP 2. 3
Setting the background color only affects subsequently written characters. Fish provides no way to set the background color for the entire terminal window. Configuring the window background color (and other attributes such as its opacity) has to be done using whatever mechanisms the terminal provides. Look for a config option.
.IP 3. 3
Some terminals use the \fB\-\-bold\fP escape sequence to switch to a brighter color set rather than increasing the weight of text.
.IP 4. 3
\fBset_color\fP works by printing sequences of characters to standard output. If used in command substitution or a pipe, these characters will also be captured. This may or may not be desirable. Checking the exit status of \fBisatty stdout\fP before using \fBset_color\fP can be useful to decide not to colorize output in a script.

.SS Description
.sp
\fBsource\fP evaluates the commands of the specified \fIFILE\fP in the current shell as a new block of code. This is different from starting a new process to perform the commands (i.e. \fBfish < FILE\fP) since the commands will be evaluated by the current shell, which means that changes in shell variables will affect the current shell. If additional arguments are specified after the file name, they will be inserted into the \fBargv\fP \%<#\:envvar-argv> variable. The \fBargv\fP \%<#\:envvar-argv> variable will not include the name of the sourced file.
.sp
fish will search the working directory to resolve relative paths but will not search \fBPATH\fP \%<#\:envvar-PATH> .
.sp
If no file is specified and a file or pipeline is connected to standard input, or if the file name \fB\-\fP is used, \fBsource\fP will read from standard input. If no file is specified and there is no redirected file or pipeline on standard input, an error will be printed.
.sp
The exit status of \fBsource\fP is the exit status of the last job to execute. If something goes wrong while opening or reading the file, \fBsource\fP exits with a non\-zero status.
.sp
Some other shells only support the \fB\&.\fP alias (a single period).
The use of \fB\&.\fP is deprecated in favour of \fBsource\fP, and \fB\&.\fP will be removed in a future version of fish.

\fBsource\fP creates a new local scope \%<#\:variables-scope>; \fBset \-\-local\fP within a sourced block will not affect variables in the enclosing scope.

\fBis\-interactive\fP, \fB\-i\fP or \fB\-\-is\-interactive\fP
Returns 0 if fish is interactive \- that is, connected to a keyboard.
.TP
\fBis\-interactive\-read\fP or \fB\-\-is\-interactive\-read\fP
Returns 0 if fish is running an interactive read \%<> builtin which is connected to a keyboard.
.TP
\fBis\-login\fP, \fB\-l\fP or \fB\-\-is\-login\fP
Returns 0 if fish is a login shell \- that is, if fish should perform login tasks such as setting up \fBPATH\fP \%<#\:envvar-PATH>\&.
.TP
\fBis\-full\-job\-control\fP or \fB\-\-is\-full\-job\-control\fP
Returns 0 if full job control is enabled.

.TP
\fBcurrent\-command\fP
Prints the name of the currently\-running function or command, like the deprecated \fB_\fP \%<#\:envvar-_> variable.
.TP
\fBcurrent\-commandline\fP
Prints the entirety of the currently\-running commandline, inclusive of all jobs and operators.
.TP
\fBfilename\fP, \fBcurrent\-filename\fP, \fB\-f\fP or \fB\-\-current\-filename\fP
Prints the filename of the currently\-running script. If the current script was called via a symlink, this will return the symlink. If the current script was received by piping into source \%<>, then this will return \fB\-\fP\&.
.TP
\fBbasename\fP
Prints just the filename of the running script, without any path components before.
.TP
\fBdirname\fP
Prints just the path to the running script, without the actual filename itself. This can be relative to \fBPWD\fP \%<#\:envvar-PWD> (including just \(dq.\(dq), depending on how the script was called. This is the same as passing the filename to \fBdirname(3)\fP\&. It\(aqs useful if you want to use other files in the current script\(aqs directory or similar.
.TP
\fBfish\-path\fP
Prints the absolute path to the currently executing instance of fish. This is a best\-effort attempt and the exact output is down to what the platform gives fish. In some cases you might only get \(dqfish\(dq.

\fBget\-file\fP \fIFILE\fP
NOTE: this subcommand is mainly intended for fish\(aqs internal use; let us know if you want to use it elsewhere.
.sp
This prints a file embedded in the fish binary at compile time. This includes the default set of functions and completions,

\fBterminal\fP
Prints the name and version of the terminal fish is running inside (for example as reported via XTVERSION \%<#\:term-compat-xtversion>).
This is not available during early startup but only starting from when the first interactive prompt is shown, possibly via builtin read \%<>,
so before the first \fBfish_prompt\fP or \fBfish_read\fP event \%<#\:event>\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fBtest\-terminal\-feature\fP \fIFEATURE\fP
Returns 0 when the terminal was detected \%<#\:term-compat-xtgettcap> to support the given feature.
Like status terminal, this only works once the first interactive prompt is shown.
.sp
Currently the only available \fIFEATURE\fP is scroll\-content\-up \%<#\:term-compat-indn>\&.
An error will be printed when passed an unrecognized feature.
.UNINDENT
.SS Notes

.SS Description
.sp
\fBstring\fP performs operations on strings.
.sp
\fISTRING\fP arguments are taken from the command line unless standard input is connected to a pipe or a file, in which case they are read from standard input, one \fISTRING\fP per line. It is an error to supply \fISTRING\fP arguments on the command line and on standard input.
.sp
Arguments beginning with \fB\-\fP are normally interpreted as switches; \fB\-\-\fP causes the following arguments not to be treated as switches even if they begin with \fB\-\fP\&. Switches and required arguments are recognized only on the command line.
.sp
Most subcommands accept a \fB\-q\fP or \fB\-\-quiet\fP switch, which suppresses the usual output but exits with the documented status. In this case these commands will quit early, without reading all of the available input.
.sp
The following subcommands are available.
.SS \(dqcollect\(dq subcommand
.nf
\fBstring\fP \fBcollect\fP [\fB\-a\fP | \fB\-\-allow\-empty\fP] [\fB\-N\fP | \fB\-\-no\-trim\-newlines\fP] [\fISTRING\fP \&...]
.fi
.sp
.sp
\fBstring collect\fP collects its input into a single output argument, without splitting the output when used in a command substitution. This is useful when trying to collect multiline output from another command into a variable. Exit status: 0 if any output argument is non\-empty, or 1 otherwise.
.sp
A command like \fBecho (cmd | string collect)\fP is mostly equivalent to a quoted command substitution (\fBecho \(dq$(cmd)\(dq\fP). The main difference is that the former evaluates to zero or one elements whereas the quoted command substitution always evaluates to one element due to string interpolation.
.sp
If invoked with multiple arguments instead of input, \fBstring collect\fP preserves each argument separately, where the number of output arguments is equal to the number of arguments given to \fBstring collect\fP\&.
.sp
Any trailing newlines on the input are trimmed, just as with \fB\(dq$(cmd)\(dq\fP substitution. Use \fB\-\-no\-trim\-newlines\fP to disable this behavior, which may be useful when running a command such as \fBset contents (cat filename | string collect \-N)\fP\&.
.sp
With \fB\-\-allow\-empty\fP, \fBstring collect\fP always prints one (empty) argument. This can be used to prevent an argument from disappearing.

.sp
\fBstring escape\fP escapes each \fISTRING\fP in one of several ways.
.sp
\fB\-\-style=script\fP (default) alters the string such that it can be passed back to \fBeval\fP to produce the original argument again. By default, all special characters are escaped, and quotes are used to simplify the output when possible. If \fB\-n\fP or \fB\-\-no\-quoted\fP is given, the simplifying quoted format is not used. Exit status: 0 if at least one string was escaped, or 1 otherwise.
.sp
\fB\-\-style=var\fP ensures the string can be used as a variable name by hex encoding any non\-alphanumeric characters. The string is first converted to UTF\-8 before being encoded.
.sp
\fB\-\-style=url\fP ensures the string can be used as a URL by hex encoding any character which is not legal in a URL. The string is first converted to UTF\-8 before being encoded.
.sp
\fB\-\-style=regex\fP escapes an input string for literal matching within a regex expression. The string is first converted to UTF\-8 before being encoded.
.sp
\fBstring unescape\fP performs the inverse of the \fBstring escape\fP command. If the string to be unescaped is not properly formatted it is ignored. For example, doing \fBstring unescape \-\-style=var (string escape \-\-style=var $str)\fP will return the original string. There is no support for unescaping \fB\-\-style=regex\fP\&.

\fBWARNING\fP:
Insert a  \fB\-\-\fP before positional arguments to prevent them from being interpreted as flags.
Otherwise, any strings starting with \fB\-\fP will be treated as flag arguments, meaning they will most likely result in the command failing.
This is also true if you specify a variable which expands to such a string instead of a literal string.
If you don\(aqt need to append flag arguments at the end of the command,
just always use \fB\-\-\fP to avoid unwelcome surprises.
.sp
\fBstring join0\fP adds a trailing NUL. This is most useful in conjunction with tools that accept NUL\-delimited input, such as \fBsort \-z\fP\&.
.sp
Because Unix uses NUL as the string terminator, passing the output of \fBstring join0\fP as an \fIargument\fP to a command (via a command substitution \%<#\:expand-command-substitution>) won\(aqt actually work.
Fish will pass the correct bytes along, but the command won\(aqt be able to tell where the argument ends.
This is a limitation of Unix\(aq argument passing.

\fBstring length\fP reports the length of each string argument in characters. Exit status: 0 if at least one non\-empty \fISTRING\fP was given, or 1 otherwise.
.sp
With \fB\-V\fP or \fB\-\-visible\fP, it uses the visible width of the arguments. That means it will discount escape sequences fish knows about, account for $fish_emoji_width and $fish_ambiguous_width. It will also count each line (separated by \fB\en\fP) on its own, and with a carriage return (\fB\er\fP) count only the widest stretch on a line.

.sp
.sp
\fBstring match\fP tests each \fISTRING\fP against \fIPATTERN\fP and prints matching substrings. Only the first match for each \fISTRING\fP is reported unless \fB\-a\fP or \fB\-\-all\fP is given, in which case all matches are reported.
.sp
If you specify the \fB\-e\fP or \fB\-\-entire\fP then each matching string is printed including any prefix or suffix not matched by the pattern (equivalent to \fBgrep\fP without the \fB\-o\fP flag). You can, obviously, achieve the same result by prepending and appending \fB*\fP or \fB\&.*\fP depending on whether or not you have specified the \fB\-\-regex\fP flag. The \fB\-\-entire\fP flag is a way to avoid having to complicate the pattern in that fashion and make the intent of the \fBstring match\fP clearer. Without \fB\-\-entire\fP and \fB\-\-regex\fP, a \fIPATTERN\fP will need to match the entire \fISTRING\fP before it will be reported.
.sp
Matching can be made case\-insensitive with \fB\-\-ignore\-case\fP or \fB\-i\fP\&.
.sp
If \fB\-\-groups\-only\fP or \fB\-g\fP is given, only the capturing groups will be reported \- meaning the full match will be skipped. This is incompatible with \fB\-\-entire\fP and \fB\-\-invert\fP, and requires \fB\-\-regex\fP\&. It is useful as a simple cutting tool instead of \fBstring replace\fP, so you can choose \(dqthis part\(dq of a string.
.sp
If \fB\-\-index\fP or \fB\-n\fP is given, each match is reported as a 1\-based start position and a length. By default, PATTERN is interpreted as a glob pattern matched against each entire \fISTRING\fP argument. A glob pattern is only considered a valid match if it matches the entire \fISTRING\fP\&.
.sp
If \fB\-\-regex\fP or \fB\-r\fP is given, \fIPATTERN\fP is interpreted as a Perl\-compatible regular expression, which does not have to match the entire \fISTRING\fP\&. For a regular expression containing capturing groups, multiple items will be reported for each match, one for the entire match and one for each capturing group. With this, only the matching part of the \fISTRING\fP will be reported, unless \fB\-\-entire\fP is given.
.sp
When matching via regular expressions, \fBstring match\fP automatically sets variables for all named capturing groups (\fB(?<name>expression)\fP). It will create a variable with the name of the group, in the default scope, for each named capturing group, and set it to the value of the capturing group in the first matched argument. If a named capture group matched an empty string, the variable will be set to the empty string (like \fBset var \(dq\(dq\fP). If it did not match, the variable will be set to nothing (like \fBset var\fP).  When \fB\-\-regex\fP is used with \fB\-\-all\fP, this behavior changes. Each named variable will contain a list of matches, with the first match contained in the first element, the second match in the second, and so on. If the group was empty or did not match, the corresponding element will be an empty string.
.sp
If \fB\-\-invert\fP or \fB\-v\fP is used the selected lines will be only those which do not match the given glob pattern or regular expression.
.sp
If \fB\-\-max\-matches MAX\fP or \fB\-m MAX\fP is used, \fBstring\fP will stop checking for matches after MAX lines of input have matched. This can be used as an \(dqearly exit\(dq optimization when processing long inputs but expecting a limited and fixed number of outputs that might be found considerably before the input stream has been exhausted. If combined with \fB\-\-invert\fP or \fB\-v\fP, considers only inverted matches.
.sp
Exit status: 0 if at least one match was found, or 1 otherwise.

\fBstring repeat\fP repeats the \fISTRING\fP \fB\-n\fP or \fB\-\-count\fP times. The \fB\-m\fP or \fB\-\-max\fP option will limit the number of outputted characters (excluding the newline). This option can be used by itself or in conjunction with \fB\-\-count\fP\&.

\fBstring replace\fP is similar to \fBstring match\fP but replaces non\-overlapping matching substrings with a replacement string and prints the result. By default, \fIPATTERN\fP is treated as a literal substring to be matched.
.sp
If \fB\-r\fP or \fB\-\-regex\fP is given, \fIPATTERN\fP is interpreted as a Perl\-compatible regular expression, and \fIREPLACEMENT\fP can contain C\-style escape sequences like \fBt\fP as well as references to capturing groups by number or name as \fI$n\fP or \fI${n}\fP\&.
.sp
If you specify the \fB\-f\fP or \fB\-\-filter\fP flag then each input string is printed only if a replacement was done.

In the event of \fB\-\-filter\fP or \fB\-f\fP, this means the output will be MAX lines in length. This can be used as an \(dqearly exit\(dq optimization when processing long inputs but expecting a limited and fixed number of outputs that might be found considerably before the input stream has been exhausted.

\fBstring split\fP splits each \fISTRING\fP on the separator \fISEP\fP, which can be an empty string. If \fB\-m\fP or \fB\-\-max\fP is specified, at most MAX splits are done on each \fISTRING\fP\&. If \fB\-r\fP or \fB\-\-right\fP is given, splitting is performed right\-to\-left. This is only useful in combination with \fB\-m\fP or \fB\-\-max\fP\&. With \fB\-n\fP or \fB\-\-no\-empty\fP, empty results are excluded from consideration (e.g. \fBhello\en\enworld\fP would expand to two strings and not three).

Use \fB\-f\fP or \fB\-\-fields\fP to print out specific fields. FIELDS is a comma\-separated string of field numbers and/or spans. Each field is one\-indexed, and will be printed on separate lines.

.sp
\fBstring split0\fP splits each \fISTRING\fP on the zero byte (NUL). Options are the same as \fBstring split\fP except that no separator is given.
.sp
\fBsplit0\fP has the important property that its output is not further split when used in a command substitution, allowing for the command substitution to produce elements containing newlines. This is most useful when used with Unix tools that produce zero bytes, such as \fBfind \-print0\fP or \fBsort \-z\fP\&. See split0 examples below.

Be aware that commandline arguments cannot include NULs, so you likely want to pass to \fBstring split0\fP via a pipe, not a command substitution.

.SS Comparison to other tools
.sp
Most operations \fBstring\fP supports can also be done by external tools. Some of these include \fBgrep\fP, \fBsed\fP and \fBcut\fP\&.
.sp
If you are familiar with these, it is useful to know how \fBstring\fP differs from them.
.sp
In contrast to these classics, \fBstring\fP reads input either from stdin or as arguments. \fBstring\fP also does not deal with files, so it requires redirections to be used with them.
.sp
In contrast to \fBgrep\fP, \fBstring\fP\(aqs \fBmatch\fP defaults to glob\-mode, while \fBreplace\fP defaults to literal matching. If set to regex\-mode, they use PCRE regular expressions, which is comparable to \fBgrep\fP\(aqs \fB\-P\fP option. \fBmatch\fP defaults to printing just the match, which is like \fBgrep\fP with \fB\-o\fP (use \fB\-\-entire\fP to enable grep\-like behavior).
.sp
Like \fBsed\fP\(aqs \fBs/old/new/\fP command, \fBstring replace\fP still prints strings that don\(aqt match. \fBsed\fP\(aqs \fB\-n\fP in combination with a \fB/p\fP modifier or command is like \fBstring replace \-f\fP\&.

.SS Description
.sp
\fBstring collect\fP collects its input into a single output argument, without splitting the output when used in a command substitution. This is useful when trying to collect multiline output from another command into a variable. Exit status: 0 if any output argument is non\-empty, or 1 otherwise.
.sp
A command like \fBecho (cmd | string collect)\fP is mostly equivalent to a quoted command substitution (\fBecho \(dq$(cmd)\(dq\fP). The main difference is that the former evaluates to zero or one elements whereas the quoted command substitution always evaluates to one element due to string interpolation.
.sp
If invoked with multiple arguments instead of input, \fBstring collect\fP preserves each argument separately, where the number of output arguments is equal to the number of arguments given to \fBstring collect\fP\&.
.sp
Any trailing newlines on the input are trimmed, just as with \fB\(dq$(cmd)\(dq\fP substitution. Use \fB\-\-no\-trim\-newlines\fP to disable this behavior, which may be useful when running a command such as \fBset contents (cat filename | string collect \-N)\fP\&.
.sp
With \fB\-\-allow\-empty\fP, \fBstring collect\fP always prints one (empty) argument. This can be used to prevent an argument from disappearing.

\fBstring escape\fP escapes each \fISTRING\fP in one of several ways.
.sp
\fB\-\-style=script\fP (default) alters the string such that it can be passed back to \fBeval\fP to produce the original argument again. By default, all special characters are escaped, and quotes are used to simplify the output when possible. If \fB\-n\fP or \fB\-\-no\-quoted\fP is given, the simplifying quoted format is not used. Exit status: 0 if at least one string was escaped, or 1 otherwise.
.sp
\fB\-\-style=var\fP ensures the string can be used as a variable name by hex encoding any non\-alphanumeric characters. The string is first converted to UTF\-8 before being encoded.
.sp
\fB\-\-style=url\fP ensures the string can be used as a URL by hex encoding any character which is not legal in a URL. The string is first converted to UTF\-8 before being encoded.
.sp
\fB\-\-style=regex\fP escapes an input string for literal matching within a regex expression. The string is first converted to UTF\-8 before being encoded.
.sp
\fBstring unescape\fP performs the inverse of the \fBstring escape\fP command. If the string to be unescaped is not properly formatted it is ignored. For example, doing \fBstring unescape \-\-style=var (string escape \-\-style=var $str)\fP will return the original string. There is no support for unescaping \fB\-\-style=regex\fP\&.

.sp
\fBstring join0\fP adds a trailing NUL. This is most useful in conjunction with tools that accept NUL\-delimited input, such as \fBsort \-z\fP\&.
.sp
Because Unix uses NUL as the string terminator, passing the output of \fBstring join0\fP as an \fIargument\fP to a command (via a command substitution \%<#\:expand-command-substitution>) won\(aqt actually work.

Because Unix uses NUL as the string terminator, passing the output of \fBstring join0\fP as an \fIargument\fP to a command (via a command substitution \%<#\:expand-command-substitution>) won\(aqt actually work.
Fish will pass the correct bytes along, but the command won\(aqt be able to tell where the argument ends.
This is a limitation of Unix\(aq argument passing.

.sp
With \fB\-V\fP or \fB\-\-visible\fP, it uses the visible width of the arguments. That means it will discount escape sequences fish knows about, account for $fish_emoji_width and $fish_ambiguous_width. It will also count each line (separated by \fB\en\fP) on its own, and with a carriage return (\fB\er\fP) count only the widest stretch on a line. The intent is to measure the number of columns the \fISTRING\fP would occupy in the current terminal.

.fi
.sp
.SS Description
.sp
\fBstring match\fP tests each \fISTRING\fP against \fIPATTERN\fP and prints matching substrings. Only the first match for each \fISTRING\fP is reported unless \fB\-a\fP or \fB\-\-all\fP is given, in which case all matches are reported.
.sp
If you specify the \fB\-e\fP or \fB\-\-entire\fP then each matching string is printed including any prefix or suffix not matched by the pattern (equivalent to \fBgrep\fP without the \fB\-o\fP flag). You can, obviously, achieve the same result by prepending and appending \fB*\fP or \fB\&.*\fP depending on whether or not you have specified the \fB\-\-regex\fP flag. The \fB\-\-entire\fP flag is a way to avoid having to complicate the pattern in that fashion and make the intent of the \fBstring match\fP clearer. Without \fB\-\-entire\fP and \fB\-\-regex\fP, a \fIPATTERN\fP will need to match the entire \fISTRING\fP before it will be reported.
.sp
Matching can be made case\-insensitive with \fB\-\-ignore\-case\fP or \fB\-i\fP\&.
.sp
If \fB\-\-groups\-only\fP or \fB\-g\fP is given, only the capturing groups will be reported \- meaning the full match will be skipped. This is incompatible with \fB\-\-entire\fP and \fB\-\-invert\fP, and requires \fB\-\-regex\fP\&. It is useful as a simple cutting tool instead of \fBstring replace\fP, so you can choose \(dqthis part\(dq of a string.
.sp
If \fB\-\-index\fP or \fB\-n\fP is given, each match is reported as a 1\-based start position and a length. By default, PATTERN is interpreted as a glob pattern matched against each entire \fISTRING\fP argument. A glob pattern is only considered a valid match if it matches the entire \fISTRING\fP\&.
.sp
If \fB\-\-regex\fP or \fB\-r\fP is given, \fIPATTERN\fP is interpreted as a Perl\-compatible regular expression, which does not have to match the entire \fISTRING\fP\&. For a regular expression containing capturing groups, multiple items will be reported for each match, one for the entire match and one for each capturing group. With this, only the matching part of the \fISTRING\fP will be reported, unless \fB\-\-entire\fP is given.
.sp
When matching via regular expressions, \fBstring match\fP automatically sets variables for all named capturing groups (\fB(?<name>expression)\fP). It will create a variable with the name of the group, in the default scope, for each named capturing group, and set it to the value of the capturing group in the first matched argument. If a named capture group matched an empty string, the variable will be set to the empty string (like \fBset var \(dq\(dq\fP). If it did not match, the variable will be set to nothing (like \fBset var\fP).  When \fB\-\-regex\fP is used with \fB\-\-all\fP, this behavior changes. Each named variable will contain a list of matches, with the first match contained in the first element, the second match in the second, and so on. If the group was empty or did not match, the corresponding element will be an empty string.
.sp
If \fB\-\-invert\fP or \fB\-v\fP is used the selected lines will be only those which do not match the given glob pattern or regular expression.
.sp
If \fB\-\-max\-matches MAX\fP or \fB\-m MAX\fP is used, \fBstring\fP will stop checking for matches after MAX lines of input have matched. This can be used as an \(dqearly exit\(dq optimization when processing long inputs but expecting a limited and fixed number of outputs that might be found considerably before the input stream has been exhausted. If combined with \fB\-\-invert\fP or \fB\-v\fP, considers only inverted matches.
.sp
Exit status: 0 if at least one match was found, or 1 otherwise.

In the event of \fB\-\-filter\fP or \fB\-f\fP, this means the output will be MAX lines in length. This can be used as an \(dqearly exit\(dq optimization when processing long inputs but expecting a limited and fixed number of outputs that might be found considerably before the input stream has been exhausted.

The escape sequences reflect what fish knows about, and how it computes its output. Your terminal might support more escapes, or not support escape sequences that fish knows about.
.sp
If \fB\-m\fP or \fB\-\-max\fP is given, truncate at the given width. Otherwise, the lowest non\-zero width of all input strings is used. A max of 0 means no shortening takes place, all STRINGs are printed as\-is.
.sp
If \fB\-N\fP or \fB\-\-no\-newline\fP is given, only the first line (or last line with \fB\-\-left\fP) of each STRING is used, and an ellipsis is added if it was multiline. This only works for STRINGs being given as arguments, multiple lines given on stdin will be interpreted as separate STRINGs instead.
.sp
If \fB\-c\fP or \fB\-\-char\fP is given, add \fICHAR\fP instead of an ellipsis. This can also be empty or more than one character.
.sp
If \fB\-l\fP or \fB\-\-left\fP is given, remove text from the left on instead, so this prints the longest \fIsuffix\fP of the string that fits. With \fB\-\-no\-newline\fP, this will take from the last line instead of the first.
.sp
If \fB\-q\fP or \fB\-\-quiet\fP is given, \fBstring shorten\fP only runs for the return value \- if anything would be shortened, it returns 0, else 1.

The default ellipsis is \fB…\fP\&. If fish thinks your system is incapable because of your locale, it will use \fB\&...\fP instead.

.SS Description
.sp
\fBstring split\fP splits each \fISTRING\fP on the separator \fISEP\fP, which can be an empty string. If \fB\-m\fP or \fB\-\-max\fP is specified, at most MAX splits are done on each \fISTRING\fP\&. If \fB\-r\fP or \fB\-\-right\fP is given, splitting is performed right\-to\-left. This is only useful in combination with \fB\-m\fP or \fB\-\-max\fP\&. With \fB\-n\fP or \fB\-\-no\-empty\fP, empty results are excluded from consideration (e.g. \fBhello\en\enworld\fP would expand to two strings and not three). Exit status: 0 if at least one split was performed, or 1 otherwise.
.sp
Use \fB\-f\fP or \fB\-\-fields\fP to print out specific fields. FIELDS is a comma\-separated string of field numbers and/or spans. Each field is one\-indexed, and will be printed on separate lines. If a given field does not exist, then the command exits with status 1 and does not print anything, unless \fB\-\-allow\-empty\fP is used.
.sp
See also the \fB\-\-delimiter\fP option of the read \%<> command.
.sp
\fBstring split0\fP splits each \fISTRING\fP on the zero byte (NUL). Options are the same as \fBstring split\fP except that no separator is given.
.sp
\fBsplit0\fP has the important property that its output is not further split when used in a command substitution, allowing for the command substitution to produce elements containing newlines. This is most useful when used with Unix tools that produce zero bytes, such as \fBfind \-print0\fP or \fBsort \-z\fP\&. See split0 examples below.
.sp
Be aware that commandline arguments cannot include NULs, so you likely want to pass to \fBstring split0\fP via a pipe, not a command substitution.

.SS Description
.sp
\fBstring split\fP splits each \fISTRING\fP on the separator \fISEP\fP, which can be an empty string. If \fB\-m\fP or \fB\-\-max\fP is specified, at most MAX splits are done on each \fISTRING\fP\&. If \fB\-r\fP or \fB\-\-right\fP is given, splitting is performed right\-to\-left. This is only useful in combination with \fB\-m\fP or \fB\-\-max\fP\&. With \fB\-n\fP or \fB\-\-no\-empty\fP, empty results are excluded from consideration (e.g. \fBhello\en\enworld\fP would expand to two strings and not three). Exit status: 0 if at least one split was performed, or 1 otherwise.
.sp
Use \fB\-f\fP or \fB\-\-fields\fP to print out specific fields. FIELDS is a comma\-separated string of field numbers and/or spans. Each field is one\-indexed, and will be printed on separate lines. If a given field does not exist, then the command exits with status 1 and does not print anything, unless \fB\-\-allow\-empty\fP is used.
.sp
See also the \fB\-\-delimiter\fP option of the read \%<> command.
.sp
\fBstring split0\fP splits each \fISTRING\fP on the zero byte (NUL). Options are the same as \fBstring split\fP except that no separator is given.
.sp
\fBsplit0\fP has the important property that its output is not further split when used in a command substitution, allowing for the command substitution to produce elements containing newlines. This is most useful when used with Unix tools that produce zero bytes, such as \fBfind \-print0\fP or \fBsort \-z\fP\&. See split0 examples below.
.sp
Be aware that commandline arguments cannot include NULs, so you likely want to pass to \fBstring split0\fP via a pipe, not a command substitution.

The start/end of the substring can be specified with \fB\-s\fP/\fB\-e\fP or \fB\-\-start\fP/\fB\-\-end\fP followed by a 1\-based index value. Positive index values are relative to the start of the string and negative index values are relative to the end of the string. The default start value is 1. The length of the substring can be specified with \fB\-l\fP or \fB\-\-length\fP\&. If the length or end is not specified, the substring continues to the end of each STRING.

.sp
.SS Description
.sp
\fBstring escape\fP escapes each \fISTRING\fP in one of several ways.
.sp
\fB\-\-style=script\fP (default) alters the string such that it can be passed back to \fBeval\fP to produce the original argument again. By default, all special characters are escaped, and quotes are used to simplify the output when possible. If \fB\-n\fP or \fB\-\-no\-quoted\fP is given, the simplifying quoted format is not used. Exit status: 0 if at least one string was escaped, or 1 otherwise.
.sp
\fB\-\-style=var\fP ensures the string can be used as a variable name by hex encoding any non\-alphanumeric characters. The string is first converted to UTF\-8 before being encoded.
.sp
\fB\-\-style=url\fP ensures the string can be used as a URL by hex encoding any character which is not legal in a URL. The string is first converted to UTF\-8 before being encoded.
.sp
\fB\-\-style=regex\fP escapes an input string for literal matching within a regex expression. The string is first converted to UTF\-8 before being encoded.
.sp
\fBstring unescape\fP performs the inverse of the \fBstring escape\fP command. If the string to be unescaped is not properly formatted it is ignored. For example, doing \fBstring unescape \-\-style=var (string escape \-\-style=var $str)\fP will return the original string. There is no support for unescaping \fB\-\-style=regex\fP\&.

.sp
\fBstring upper\fP converts each string argument to uppercase. Exit status: 0 if at least one string was converted to uppercase, else 1. This means that in conjunction with the \fB\-q\fP flag you can readily test whether a string is already uppercase.
.SS suspend \- suspend the current shell
.SS Synopsis
.nf
\fBsuspend\fP [\fB\-\-force\fP]
.fi
.sp
.SS Description
.sp
\fBsuspend\fP suspends execution of the current shell by sending it a SIGTSTP signal, returning to the controlling process. It can be resumed later by sending it a SIGCONT.  In order to prevent suspending a shell that doesn\(aqt have a controlling process, it will not suspend the shell if it is a login shell. This requirement is bypassed if the \fB\-\-force\fP option is given or the shell is not interactive.
.SS switch \- conditionally execute a block of commands
.SS Synopsis

\fBswitch\fP \fIVALUE\fP\fB;\fP [\fBcase\fP [\fIGLOB\fP \&...]\fB;\fP [\fICOMMANDS\fP \&...]\fB;\fP \&...] \fBend\fP
.fi
.sp
.SS Description
.sp
\fBswitch\fP performs one of several blocks of commands, depending on whether a specified value equals one of several globbed values. \fBcase\fP is used together with the \fBswitch\fP statement in order to determine which block should be executed.
.sp
Each \fBcase\fP command is given one or more parameters. The first \fBcase\fP command with a parameter that matches the string specified in the switch command will be evaluated. \fBcase\fP parameters may contain globs. These need to be escaped or quoted in order to avoid regular glob expansion using filenames.
.sp
Note that fish does not fall through on case statements. Only the first matching case is executed.
.sp
Note that break \%<> cannot be used to exit a case/switch block early like in other languages. It can only be used in loops.
.sp
Note that command substitutions in a case statement will be evaluated even if its body is not taken. All substitutions, including command substitutions, must be performed before the value can be compared against the parameter.
.SS Example
.sp
If the variable \fB$animal\fP contains the name of an animal, the following code would attempt to classify it:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
switch $animal
    case cat

        echo I have no idea what a $animal is
end

.SS Description
.sp
NOTE: This page documents the fish builtin \fBtest\fP\&.
To see the documentation on any non\-fish versions, use \fBcommand man test\fP\&.
.sp
\fBtest\fP checks the given conditions and sets the exit status to 0 if they are true, 1 if they are false.
.sp
The first form (\fBtest\fP) is preferred. For compatibility with other shells, the second form is available: a matching pair of square brackets (\fB[ [EXPRESSION] ]\fP).
.sp
When using a variable or command substitution as an argument with \fBtest\fP you should almost always enclose it in double\-quotes, as variables expanding to zero or more than one argument will most likely interact badly with \fBtest\fP\&.
.sp
\fBWarning:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
For historical reasons, \fBtest\fP supports the one\-argument form (\fBtest foo\fP), and this will also be triggered by e.g. \fBtest \-n $foo\fP if $foo is unset. We recommend you don\(aqt use the one\-argument form and quote all variables or command substitutions used with \fBtest\fP\&.
.sp
This confusing misfeature will be removed in future. \fBtest \-n\fP without any additional argument will be false, \fBtest \-z\fP will be true and any other invocation with exactly one or zero arguments, including \fBtest \-d\fP and \fBtest \(dqfoo\(dq\fP will be an error.
.sp
The same goes for \fB[\fP, e.g. \fB[ \(dqfoo\(dq ]\fP and \fB[ \-d ]\fP will be errors.
.sp
This can be turned on already via the \fBtest\-require\-arg\fP feature flag \%<#\:featureflags>, and will eventually become the default and then only option.

.SS time \- measure how long a command or block takes
.SS Synopsis

\fBtime\fP \fICOMMAND\fP
.fi
.sp
.SS Description
.sp
NOTE: This page documents the fish keyword \fBtime\fP\&.
To see the documentation on any non\-fish versions, use \fBcommand man time\fP\&.
.sp
\fBtime\fP causes fish to measure how long a command takes and print the results afterwards. The command can be a simple fish command or a block. The results can not currently be redirected.
.sp
For checking timing after a command has completed, check $CMD_DURATION \%<#\:variables-special>\&.
.sp
Your system most likely also has a \fBtime\fP command. To use that use something like \fBcommand time\fP, as in \fBcommand time sleep 10\fP\&. Because it\(aqs not inside fish, it won\(aqt have access to fish functions and won\(aqt be able to time blocks and such.
.SS How to interpret the output
.sp
Time outputs a few different values. Let\(aqs look at an example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> time string repeat \-n 10000000 y\en | command grep y >/dev/null
________________________________________________________
Executed in  805.98 millis    fish           external
   usr time  798.88 millis  763.88 millis   34.99 millis
   sys time  141.22 millis   40.20 millis  101.02 millis
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The time after \(dqExecuted in\(dq is what is known as the \(dqwall\-clock time\(dq. It is simply a measure of how long it took from the start of the command until it finished. Typically it is reasonably close to \fBCMD_DURATION\fP \%<#\:envvar-CMD_DURATION>, except for a slight skew because the two are taken at slightly different times.
.sp
The other times are all measures of CPU time. That means they measure how long the CPU was used in this part, and they count multiple cores separately. So a program with four threads using all CPU for a second will have a time of 4 seconds.
.sp
The \(dqusr\(dq time is how much CPU time was spent inside the program itself, the \(dqsys\(dq time is how long was spent in the kernel on behalf of that program.
.sp
The \(dqfish\(dq time is how much CPU was spent in fish, the \(dqexternal\(dq time how much was spent in external commands.
.sp
So in this example, since \fBstring\fP is a builtin, everything that \fBstring repeat\fP did is accounted to fish. Any time it spends doing syscalls like \fBwrite()\fP is accounted for in the fish/sys time.
.sp
And \fBgrep\fP here is explicitly invoked as an external command, so its times will be counted in the \(dqexternal\(dq column.
.sp
Note that, as in this example, the CPU times can add up to more than the execution time. This is because things can be done in parallel \- \fBgrep\fP can match while \fBstring repeat\fP writes.

.SS trap \- perform an action when the shell receives a signal
.SS Synopsis

\fBtrap\fP [\fIOPTIONS\fP] [[\fIARG\fP] \fIREASON\fP \&...\fB ]\fP
.fi
.sp
.SS Description
.sp
NOTE: This page documents the fish builtin \fBtrap\fP\&.
To see the documentation on any non\-fish versions, use \fBcommand man trap\fP\&.
.sp
\fBtrap\fP is a wrapper around the fish event delivery framework. It exists for backwards compatibility with POSIX shells. For other uses, it is recommended to define an event handler \%<#\:event>\&.
.sp
The following parameters are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fIARG\fP
Command to be executed on signal delivery.
.TP
.B \fIREASON\fP
Name of the event to trap. For example, a signal like \fBINT\fP or \fBSIGINT\fP, or the special symbol \fBEXIT\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-l\fP or \fB\-\-list\-signals\fP
Prints a list of signal names.
.TP
\fB\-p\fP or \fB\-\-print\fP
Prints all defined signal handlers.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP or \fB\-\-help\fP
Displays help about using this command.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If \fIARG\fP and \fIREASON\fP are both specified, \fIARG\fP is the command to be executed when the event specified by \fIREASON\fP occurs (e.g., the signal is delivered).
.sp
If \fIARG\fP is absent (and there is a single \fIREASON\fP) or \fB\-\fP, each specified signal is reset to its original disposition (the value it had upon entrance to the shell).  If \fIARG\fP is the null string the signal specified by each \fIREASON\fP is ignored by the shell and by the commands it invokes.
.sp
If \fIARG\fP is not present and \fB\-p\fP has been supplied, then the trap commands associated with each \fIREASON\fP are displayed. If no arguments are supplied or if only \fB\-p\fP is given, \fBtrap\fP prints the list of commands associated with each signal.
.sp
Signal names are case insensitive and the \fBSIG\fP prefix is optional. Trapping a signal will prevent fish from exiting in response to that signal.
.sp
The exit status is 1 if any \fIREASON\fP is invalid; otherwise trap returns 0.
.SS Example

.SS Description
.sp
NOTE: This page documents the fish builtin \fBtype\fP\&.
To see the documentation on any non\-fish versions, use \fBcommand man type\fP\&.
.sp
With no options, \fBtype\fP indicates how each \fINAME\fP would be interpreted if used as a command name.
.sp
The following options are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-a\fP or \fB\-\-all\fP
Prints all of possible definitions of the specified names.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP or \fB\-\-short\fP
Don\(aqt print function definitions when used with no options or with \fB\-a\fP/\fB\-\-all\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-f\fP or \fB\-\-no\-functions\fP
Suppresses function lookup.
.TP
\fB\-t\fP or \fB\-\-type\fP
Prints \fBfunction\fP, \fBbuiltin\fP, or \fBfile\fP if \fINAME\fP is a shell function, builtin, or disk file, respectively.
.TP
\fB\-p\fP or \fB\-\-path\fP
Prints the path to \fINAME\fP if \fINAME\fP resolves to an executable file in \fBPATH\fP \%<#\:envvar-PATH>, the path to the script containing the definition of the function \fINAME\fP if \fINAME\fP resolves to a function loaded from a file on disk (i.e. not interactively defined at the prompt), or nothing otherwise.
.TP
\fB\-P\fP or \fB\-\-force\-path\fP
Returns the path to the executable file \fINAME\fP, presuming \fINAME\fP is found in the \fBPATH\fP \%<#\:envvar-PATH> environment variable, or nothing otherwise. \fB\-\-force\-path\fP explicitly resolves only the path to executable files in  \fBPATH\fP \%<#\:envvar-PATH>, regardless of whether \fINAME\fP is shadowed by a function or builtin with the same name.
.TP
\fB\-q\fP or \fB\-\-query\fP
Suppresses all output; this is useful when testing the exit status. For compatibility with old fish versions this is also \fB\-\-quiet\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP or \fB\-\-help\fP
Displays help about using this command.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fB\-q\fP, \fB\-p\fP, \fB\-t\fP and \fB\-P\fP flags (and their long flag aliases) are mutually exclusive. Only one can be specified at a time.

.SS Description
.sp
\fBulimit\fP sets or outputs the resource usage limits of the shell and any processes spawned by it. If a new limit value is omitted, the current value of the limit of the resource is printed; otherwise, the specified limit is set to the new value.
.sp
Use one of the following switches to specify which resource limit to set or report:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-b\fP or \fB\-\-socket\-buffers\fP
The maximum size of socket buffers.
.TP
\fB\-c\fP or \fB\-\-core\-size\fP
The maximum size of core files created. By setting this limit to zero, core dumps can be disabled.
.TP
\fB\-d\fP or \fB\-\-data\-size\fP
The maximum size of a process\(aq data segment.
.TP
\fB\-e\fP or \fB\-\-nice\fP
Controls the maximum nice value; on Linux, this value is subtracted from 20 to give the effective value.
.TP
\fB\-f\fP or \fB\-\-file\-size\fP
The maximum size of files created by a process.
.TP
\fB\-i\fP or \fB\-\-pending\-signals\fP
The maximum number of signals that may be queued.

The maximum realtime scheduling priority.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP or \fB\-\-stack\-size\fP
The maximum stack size.
.TP
\fB\-t\fP or \fB\-\-cpu\-time\fP
The maximum amount of CPU time in seconds.
.TP
\fB\-u\fP or \fB\-\-process\-count\fP
The maximum number of processes available to the current user.
.TP
\fB\-w\fP or \fB\-\-swap\-size\fP
The maximum swap space available to the current user.
.TP
\fB\-v\fP or \fB\-\-virtual\-memory\-size\fP
The maximum amount of virtual memory available to the shell.
.TP
\fB\-y\fP or \fB\-\-realtime\-maxtime\fP
The maximum contiguous realtime CPU time in microseconds.
.TP
\fB\-K\fP or \fB\-\-kernel\-queues\fP
The maximum number of kqueues (kernel queues) for the current user.
.TP
\fB\-P\fP or \fB\-\-ptys\fP
The maximum number of pseudo\-terminals for the current user.
.TP
\fB\-T\fP or \fB\-\-threads\fP
The maximum number of simultaneous threads for the current user.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that not all these limits are available in all operating systems; consult the documentation for \fBsetrlimit\fP in your operating system.
.sp
The value of limit can be a number in the unit specified for the resource or one of the special values \fBhard\fP, \fBsoft\fP, or \fBunlimited\fP, which stand for the current hard limit, the current soft limit, and no limit, respectively.
.sp
If limit is given, it is the new value of the specified resource. If no option is given, then \fB\-f\fP is assumed. Values are in kilobytes, except for \fB\-t\fP, which is in seconds and \fB\-n\fP and \fB\-u\fP, which are unscaled values. The exit status is 0 unless an invalid option or argument is supplied, or an error occurs while setting a new limit.
.sp
\fBulimit\fP also accepts the following options that determine what type of limit to set:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-H\fP or \fB\-\-hard\fP
Sets hard resource limit.
.TP
\fB\-S\fP or \fB\-\-soft\fP
Sets soft resource limit.
.UNINDENT
.sp
A hard limit can only be decreased. Once it is set it cannot be increased; a soft limit may be increased up to the value of the hard limit. If neither \fB\-H\fP nor \fB\-S\fP is specified, both the soft and hard limits are updated when assigning a new limit value, and the soft limit is used when reporting the current value.
.sp
The following additional options are also understood by \fBulimit\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-a\fP or \fB\-\-all\fP
Prints all current limits.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP or \fB\-\-help\fP

The \fBfish\fP implementation of \fBulimit\fP should behave identically to the implementation in bash, except for these differences:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Fish \fBulimit\fP supports GNU\-style long options for all switches.
.IP \(bu 2
Fish \fBulimit\fP does not support the \fB\-p\fP option for getting the pipe size. The bash implementation consists of a compile\-time check that empirically guesses this number by writing to a pipe and waiting for SIGPIPE. Fish does not do this because this method of determining pipe size is unreliable. Depending on bash version, there may also be further additional limits to set in bash that do not exist in fish.
.IP \(bu 2
Fish \fBulimit\fP does not support getting or setting multiple limits in one command, except reporting all values using the \fB\-a\fP switch.

.sp
.SS Description
.sp
NOTE: This page documents the fish builtin \fBumask\fP\&.
To see the documentation on any non\-fish versions, use \fBcommand man umask\fP\&.
.sp
\fBumask\fP displays and manipulates the \(dqumask\(dq, or file creation mode mask, which is used to restrict the default access to files.
.sp
The umask may be expressed either as an octal number, which represents the rights that will be removed by default, or symbolically, which represents the only rights that will be granted by default.
.sp
Access rights are explained in the manual page for the \fBchmod(1)\fP program.
.sp
With no parameters, the current file creation mode mask is printed as an octal number.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-S\fP or \fB\-\-symbolic\fP

.TP
\fB\-h\fP or \fB\-\-help\fP

.UNINDENT
.sp
If a numeric mask is specified as a parameter, the current shell\(aqs umask will be set to that value, and the rights specified by that mask will be removed from new files and directories by default.
.sp
If a symbolic mask is specified, the desired permission bits, and not the inverse, should be specified. A symbolic mask is a comma separated list of rights. Each right consists of three parts:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The first part specifies to whom this set of right applies, and can be one of \fBu\fP, \fBg\fP, \fBo\fP or \fBa\fP, where \fBu\fP specifies the user who owns the file, \fBg\fP specifies the group owner of the file, \fBo\fP specific other users rights and \fBa\fP specifies all three should be changed.
.IP \(bu 2
The second part of a right specifies the mode, and can be one of \fB=\fP, \fB+\fP or \fB\-\fP, where \fB=\fP specifies that the rights should be set to the new value, \fB+\fP specifies that the specified right should be added to those previously specified and \fB\-\fP specifies that the specified rights should be removed from those previously specified.
.IP \(bu 2
The third part of a right specifies what rights should be changed and can be any combination of \fBr\fP, \fBw\fP and \fBx\fP, representing read, write and execute rights.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the first and second parts are skipped, they are assumed to be \fBa\fP and \fB=\fP, respectively. As an example, \fBr,u+w\fP means all users should have read access and the file owner should also have write access.
.sp
Note that symbolic masks currently do not work as intended.
.SS Example
.sp
\fBumask 177\fP or \fBumask u=rw\fP sets the file creation mask to read and write for the owner and no permissions at all for any other users.

.SS Fish for bash users
.sp
This is to give you a quick overview if you come from bash (or to a lesser extent other shells like zsh or ksh) and want to know how fish differs. Fish is intentionally not POSIX\-compatible and as such some of the things you are used to work differently.
.sp
Many things are similar \- they both fundamentally expand commandlines to execute commands, have pipes, redirections, variables, globs, use command output in various ways. This document is there to quickly show you the differences.
.SS Command substitutions
.sp
Fish spells command substitutions as \fB$(command)\fP or \fB(command)\fP, but not \fB\(gacommand\(ga\fP\&.
.sp
In addition, it only splits them on newlines instead of $IFS. If you want to split on something else, use string split \%<>, string split0 \%<> or string collect \%<>\&. If those are used as the last command in a command substitution the splits they create are carried over. So:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX

.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
will correctly handle all possible filenames.
.SS Variables
.sp
Fish sets and erases variables with set \%<> instead of \fBVAR=VAL\fP and a variety of separate builtins like \fBdeclare\fP and \fBunset\fP and \fBexport\fP\&. \fBset\fP takes options to determine the scope and exportedness of a variable:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# Define $PAGER *g*lobal and e*x*ported,
# so this is like \(ga\(gaexport PAGER=less\(ga\(ga
set \-gx PAGER less

# Define $alocalvariable only locally,
# like \(ga\(galocal alocalvariable=foo\(ga\(ga
set \-l alocalvariable foo
.EE
.UNINDENT

or to erase variables:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set \-e PAGER
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBVAR=VAL\fP statements are available as environment overrides:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX

.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Fish does not perform word splitting. Once a variable has been set to a value, that value stays as it is, so double\-quoting variable expansions isn\(aqt the necessity it is in bash. [1]
.sp
For instance, here\(aqs bash
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> foo=\(dqbar baz\(dq
> printf \(aq\(dq%s\(dq\en\(aq $foo
# will print two lines, because we didn\(aqt double\-quote
# this is word splitting
\(dqbar\(dq
\(dqbaz\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And here is fish:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> set foo \(dqbar baz\(dq
> printf \(aq\(dq%s\(dq\en\(aq $foo
# foo was set as one element,
# so it will be passed as one element, so this is one line
\(dqbar baz\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
All variables are \(dqarrays\(dq (we use the term \(dqlists\(dq), and expanding a variable expands to all its elements, with each element as its own argument (like bash\(aqs \fB\(dq${var[@]}\(dq\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> set var \(dqfoo bar\(dq banana

The arguments to \fBset\fP are ordinary, so you can also set a variable to the output of a command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# Set lines to all the lines in file, one element per line
set lines (cat file)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
or a mixture of literal values and output:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
A \fB=\fP is unnecessary and unhelpful with \fBset\fP \- \fBset foo = bar\fP will set the variable \(dqfoo\(dq to two values: \(dq=\(dq and \(dqbar\(dq. \fBset foo=bar\fP will print an error.
.sp
See Shell variables \%<#\:variables> for more.
.IP [1] 5
zsh also does not perform word splitting by default (the SH_WORD_SPLIT option controls this)
.SS Wildcards (globs)
.sp
Fish only supports the \fB*\fP and \fB**\fP glob (and the deprecated \fB?\fP glob) as syntax. If a glob doesn\(aqt match it fails the command (like with bash\(aqs \fBfailglob\fP) unless the command is \fBfor\fP, \fBset\fP or \fBcount\fP or the glob is used with an environment override (\fBVAR=* command\fP), in which case it expands to nothing (like with bash\(aqs \fBnullglob\fP option).
.sp
Globbing doesn\(aqt happen on expanded variables, so:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set foo \(dq*\(dq
echo $foo
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
will not match any files.
.sp
There are no options to control globbing so it always behaves like that.
.sp
The \fB**\fP glob will match in subdirectories as well. In other shells this often needs to be turned on with an option, like \fBsetopt globstar\fP in bash.
.sp
Unlike bash, fish will also follow symlinks, and will sort the results in a natural sort, with included numbers compared as numbers. That means it will sort e.g. music tracks correctly even if they have numbers like \fB1\fP instead of \fB01\fP\&.
.sp
See Wildcards \%<#\:expand-wildcard> for more.
.SS Quoting
.sp
Fish has two quoting styles: \fB\(dq\(dq\fP and \fB\(aq\(aq\fP\&. Variables are expanded in double\-quotes, nothing is expanded in single\-quotes.
.sp
There is no \fB$\(aq\(aq\fP, instead the sequences that would transform are transformed \fIwhen unquoted\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> echo a\enb

.EE
.UNINDENT

.sp
See Quotes \%<#\:quotes> for more.
.SS String manipulation
.sp
Fish does not have \fB${foo%bar}\fP, \fB${foo#bar}\fP and \fB${foo/bar/baz}\fP\&. Instead string manipulation is done by the string \%<> builtin.
.sp
For example, to replace \(dqbar\(dq with \(dqbaz\(dq:
.INDENT 0.0

Some bash variables and their closest fish equivalent:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB$*\fP, \fB$@\fP, \fB$1\fP and so on: \fB$argv\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fB$?\fP: \fB$status\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fB$$\fP: \fB$fish_pid\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fB$#\fP: No variable, instead use \fBcount $argv\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fB$!\fP: \fB$last_pid\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fB$0\fP: \fBstatus filename\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fB$\-\fP: Mostly \fBstatus is\-interactive\fP and \fBstatus is\-login\fP
.UNINDENT
.SS Process substitution
.sp
Instead of \fB<(command)\fP fish uses \fB(command | psub)\fP\&. There is no equivalent to \fB>(command)\fP\&.
.sp
Note that both of these are bashisms, and most things can easily be expressed without. E.g. instead of:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
source (command | psub)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Use:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
command | source
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
as fish\(aqs source \%<> can read from stdin.
.SS Heredocs
.sp
Fish does not have \fB<<EOF\fP \(dqheredocs\(dq. Instead of
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
cat <<EOF
some string
some more string
EOF
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
use:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
printf %s\en \(dqsome string\(dq \(dqsome more string\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
or:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
echo \(dqsome string
some more string\(dq

# or if you want the quotes on separate lines:

echo \(dq\e
some string
some more string\e
\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Quotes are followed across newlines.
.sp
What \(dqheredocs\(dq do is:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Read/interpret the string, with special rules, up to the terminator. [2]
.IP 2. 3
Write the resulting string to a temporary file.
.IP 3. 3
Start the command the heredoc is attached to with that file as stdin.
.UNINDENT
.sp
This means it is essentially the same as just reading from a pipe, so:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
echo \(dqfoo\(dq | cat
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
is mostly the same as
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
cat <<EOF
foo
EOF
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Like with heredocs, the command has to be prepared to read from stdin. Sometimes this requires special options to be used, often giving a filename of \fB\-\fP turns it on.
.sp
For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
echo \(dqxterm
rxvt\-unicode\(dq | pacman \-\-remove \-

# is the same as (the \(ga\-\(ga makes pacman read arguments from stdin)
pacman \-\-remove xterm rxvt\-unicode
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
and could be written in other shells as
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# This \(dq\-\(dq is still necessary \- the heredoc is *also* passed over stdin!
pacman \-\-remove \- << EOF
xterm
rxvt\-unicode
EOF
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
So heredocs really are minor syntactical sugar that introduces a lot of special rules, which is why fish doesn\(aqt have them. Pipes are a core concept, and are simpler and compose nicer.
.IP [2] 5
For example, the \(dqEOF\(dq is just a convention, the terminator can be an arbitrary string, something like \(dqTHISISTHEEND\(dq also works. And using \fB<<\-\fP trims leading \fItab\fP characters (but not other whitespace), so you can indent the lines, but only with tabs. Substitutions (variables, commands) are done on the heredoc by default, but not if the terminator is quoted: \fBcat << \(dqEOF\(dq\fP\&.
.SS Test (\fBtest\fP, \fB[\fP, \fB[[\fP)
.sp
Fish has a POSIX\-compatible \fBtest\fP or \fB[\fP builtin. There is no \fB[[\fP and \fBtest\fP does not accept \fB==\fP as a synonym for \fB=\fP\&. It can compare floating point numbers, however.
.sp
\fBset \-q\fP can be used to determine if a variable exists or has a certain number of elements (\fBset \-q foo[2]\fP).
.SS Arithmetic Expansion
.sp
Fish does not have \fB$((i+1))\fP arithmetic expansion, computation is handled by math \%<>:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
math $i + 1
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Unlike bash\(aqs arithmetic, it can handle floating point numbers:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> math 5 / 2
2.5
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And also has some functions, like for trigonometry:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> math cos 2 x pi
1
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can pass arguments to \fBmath\fP separately like above or in quotes. Because fish uses \fB()\fP parentheses for command substitutions, quoting is needed if you want to use them in your expression:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> math \(aq(5 + 2) * 4\(aq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Both \fB*\fP and \fBx\fP are valid ways to spell multiplication, but \fB*\fP needs to be quoted because it looks like a glob\&.
.SS Prompts
.sp
Fish does not use the \fB$PS1\fP, \fB$PS2\fP and so on variables. Instead the prompt is the output of the fish_prompt \%<> function, plus the fish_mode_prompt \%<> function if vi mode \%<#\:vi-mode> is enabled. The output of the fish_right_prompt \%<> function is used for the right\-sided prompt.
.sp
As an example, here\(aqs a relatively simple bash prompt:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# <$HOSTNAME> <$PWD in blue> <Prompt Sign in Yellow> <Rest in default light white>
PS1=\(aq\eh\e[\ee[1;34m\e]\ew\e[\ee[m\e] \e[\ee[1;32m\e]\e$\e[\ee[m\e] \(aq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
and a rough fish equivalent:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
function fish_prompt
    set \-l prompt_symbol \(aq$\(aq
    fish_is_root_user; and set prompt_symbol \(aq#\(aq

    echo \-s (prompt_hostname) \e
    (set_color blue) (prompt_pwd) \e
    (set_color yellow) $prompt_symbol (set_color normal)
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This shows a few differences:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Fish provides set_color \%<> to color text. It can use the 16 named colors and also RGB sequences (so you could also use \fBset_color 5555FF\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
Instead of introducing specific escapes like \fB\eh\fP for the hostname, the prompt is a function. To achieve the effect of \fB\eh\fP, fish provides helper functions like prompt_hostname \%<>, which prints a shortened version of the hostname.
.IP \(bu 2
Fish offers other helper functions for adding things to the prompt, like fish_vcs_prompt \%<> for adding a display for common version control systems (git, mercurial, svn), and prompt_pwd \%<> for showing a shortened \fB$PWD\fP (the user\(aqs home directory becomes \fB~\fP and any path component is shortened).
.UNINDENT
.sp
The default prompt is reasonably full\-featured and its code can be read via \fBtype fish_prompt\fP\&.
.sp
Fish does not have \fB$PS2\fP for continuation lines, instead it leaves the lines indented to show that the commandline isn\(aqt complete yet.
.SS Blocks and loops
.sp
Fish\(aqs blocking constructs look a little different. They all start with a word, end in \fBend\fP and don\(aqt have a second starting word:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
for i in 1 2 3; do
   echo $i
done

# becomes

for i in 1 2 3
   echo $i
end

while true; do
   echo Weeee
done

# becomes

while true
   echo Weeeeeee
end

{
   echo Hello
}

# becomes

begin
   echo Hello
end

if true; then
   echo Yes I am true
else
   echo \(dqHow is true not true?\(dq
fi

# becomes

if true
   echo Yes I am true
else
   echo \(dqHow is true not true?\(dq
end

foo() {
   echo foo
}

# becomes

function foo
    echo foo
end

# (bash allows the word \(dqfunction\(dq,
#  but this is an extension)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Fish does not have an \fBuntil\fP\&. Use \fBwhile not\fP or \fBwhile !\fP\&.
.SS Subshells
.sp
Bash has a feature called \(dqsubshells\(dq, where it will start another shell process for certain things. That shell will then be independent and e.g. any changes it makes to variables won\(aqt be visible in the main shell.
.sp
This includes things like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# A list of commands in \(ga()\(ga parentheses
(foo; bar) | baz

# Both sides of a pipe
foo | while read \-r bar; do
    # This will not be visible outside of the loop.
    VAR=VAL
    # This background process will not be, either
    baz &
done
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Fish does not currently have subshells. You will have to find a different solution. The isolation can usually be achieved by scoping variables (with \fBset \-l\fP), but if you really do need to run your code in a new shell environment you can use \fBfish \-c \(aqyour code here\(aq\fP to do so explicitly.
.sp
\fB()\fP subshells are often confused with \fB{}\fP grouping, which does \fInot\fP use a subshell. When you just need to group, you can use \fBbegin; end\fP in fish:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
(foo; bar) | baz
# when it should really have been:
{ foo; bar; } | baz
# becomes
begin; foo; bar; end | baz
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The pipe will be run in the same process, so \fBwhile read\fP loops can set variables outside:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
foo | while read bar
    set \-g VAR VAL
    baz &
end

echo $VAR # will print VAL
jobs # will show \(dqbaz\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Subshells are also frequently confused with command substitutions, which bash writes as \fB\(gacommand\(ga\fP or \fB$(command)\fP and fish writes as \fB$(command)\fP or \fB(command)\fP\&. Bash also \fIuses\fP subshells to implement them.
.SS Builtins and other commands
.sp
By now it has become apparent that fish puts much more of a focus on its builtins and external commands rather than its syntax. So here are some helpful builtins and their rough equivalent in bash:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
string \%<> \- this replaces most of the string transformation (\fB${i%foo}\fP et al) and can also be used instead of \fBgrep\fP and \fBsed\fP and such.
.IP \(bu 2
math \%<> \- this replaces \fB$((i + 1))\fP arithmetic and can also do floats and some simple functions (sine and friends).
.IP \(bu 2
argparse \%<> \- this can handle a script\(aqs option parsing, for which bash would probably use \fBgetopt\fP (zsh provides \fBzparseopts\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
count \%<> can be used to count things and therefore replaces \fB$#\fP and can be used instead of \fBwc\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
status \%<> provides information about the shell status, e.g. if it\(aqs interactive or what the current linenumber is. This replaces \fB$\-\fP and \fB$BASH_LINENO\fP and other variables.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBseq(1)\fP can be used as a replacement for \fB{1..10}\fP range expansion. If your OS doesn\(aqt ship a \fBseq\fP fish includes a replacement function.
.UNINDENT
.SS Other facilities
.sp
Bash has \fBset \-x\fP or \fBset \-o xtrace\fP to print all commands that are being executed. In fish, this would be enabled by setting \fBfish_trace\fP \%<#\:envvar-fish_trace>\&.
.sp
Or, if your intention is to \fIprofile\fP how long each line of a script takes, you can use \fBfish \-\-profile\fP \- see the page for the fish command \%<>\&.
.SS Tutorial
.SS Why fish?
.sp
Fish is a fully\-equipped command line shell (like bash or zsh) that is smart and user\-friendly. Fish supports powerful features like syntax highlighting, autosuggestions, and tab completions that just work, with nothing to learn or configure.
.sp
If you want to make your command line more productive, more useful, and more fun, without learning a bunch of arcane syntax and configuration options, then fish might be just what you\(aqre looking for!
.SS Getting started
.sp
Once installed, just type in \fBfish\fP into your current shell to try it out!
.sp
You will be greeted by the standard fish prompt,
which means you are all set up and can start using fish:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> fish
Welcome to fish, the friendly interactive shell
Type help for instructions on how to use fish
you@hostname ~>
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This prompt that you see above is the fish default prompt: it shows your username, hostname, and working directory. You can customize it, see how to change your prompt \%<#\:prompt>\&.
.sp
From now on, we\(aqll pretend your prompt is just a \fB>\fP to save space.
.SS Learning fish
.sp
This tutorial assumes a basic understanding of command line shells and Unix commands, and that you have a working copy of fish.
.sp
If you have a strong understanding of other shells, and want to know what fish does differently, search for the magic phrase \fIunlike other shells\fP, which is used to call out important differences.
.sp
Or, if you want a quick overview over the differences to other shells like Bash, see Fish For Bash Users \%<>\&.
.sp
For the full, detailed description of how to use fish interactively, see Interactive Use \%<>\&.
.sp
For a comprehensive description of fish\(aqs scripting language, see The Fish Language \%<>\&.
.SS Running Commands
.sp
Fish runs commands like other shells: you type a command, followed by its arguments. Spaces are separators:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> echo hello world
hello world
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This runs the command \fBecho\fP with the arguments \fBhello\fP and \fBworld\fP\&. In this case that\(aqs the same as one argument \fBhello world\fP, but in many cases it\(aqs not. If you need to pass an argument that includes a space, you can escape \%<#\:escapes> with a backslash, or quote \%<#\:quotes> it using single or double quotes:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> mkdir My\e Files
# Makes a directory called \(dqMy Files\(dq, with a space in the name
> cp ~/Some\e File \(aqMy Files\(aq
# Copies a file called \(dqSome File\(dq in the home directory to \(dqMy Files\(dq
> ls \(dqMy Files\(dq
Some File
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Getting Help
.sp
Run \fBhelp\fP to open fish\(aqs help in a web browser, and \fBman\fP with the page (like \fBfish\-language\fP) to open it in a man page. You can also ask for help with a specific command, for example, \fBhelp set\fP to open in a web browser, or \fBman set\fP to see it in the terminal.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> man set
set \- handle shell variables
  Synopsis...
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To open this section, use \fBhelp getting\-help\fP\&.
.sp
This only works for fish\(aqs own documentation for itself and its built\-in commands (the \(dqbuiltins\(dq). For any other commands on your system, they should provide their own documentation, often in the man system. For example \fBman ls\fP should tell you about your computer\(aqs \fBls\fP command.
.SS Syntax Highlighting
.sp
You\(aqll quickly notice that fish performs syntax highlighting as you type. Invalid commands are colored red by default:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> /bin/mkd
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
A command may be invalid because it does not exist, or refers to a file that you cannot execute. When the command becomes valid, it is shown in a different color:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> /bin/mkdir
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Valid file paths are underlined as you type them:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> cat ~/somefi
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This tells you that there exists a file that starts with \fBsomefi\fP, which is useful feedback as you type.
.sp
These colors, and many more, can be changed by running \fBfish_config\fP, or by modifying color variables \%<#\:variables-color> directly.
.sp
For example, if you want to disable (almost) all coloring:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
fish_config theme choose None
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This picks the \(dqnone\(dq theme. To see all themes:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
fish_config theme show
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Just running \fBfish_config\fP will open up a browser interface that allows you to pick from the available themes.
.SS Autosuggestions
.sp
As you type fish will suggest commands to the right of the cursor, in gray. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> /bin/hostname
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
It knows about paths and options:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> grep \-\-ignore\-case
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And history too. Type a command once, and you can re\-summon it by just typing a few letters:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> rsync \-avze ssh . myname@somelonghost.com:/some/long/path/doo/dee/doo/dee/doo
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To accept the autosuggestion, hit \fBright\fP (\fB→\fP) or \fBctrl\fP\-\fBf\fP\&. To accept a single word of the autosuggestion, \fBalt\fP\-\fBright\fP (\fB→\fP). If the autosuggestion is not what you want, just ignore it.
.sp
If you don\(aqt like autosuggestions, you can disable them by setting \fB$fish_autosuggestion_enabled\fP to 0:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set \-g fish_autosuggestion_enabled 0
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Tab Completions
.sp
A rich set of tab completions work \(dqout of the box\(dq.
.sp
Press \fBtab\fP and fish will attempt to complete the command, argument, or path:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> /pri\fBtab\fP => /private/
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If there\(aqs more than one possibility, it will list them:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> ~/stuff/s\fBtab\fP
~/stuff/script.sh  (command)  ~/stuff/sources/  (directory)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Hit tab again to cycle through the possibilities. The part in parentheses there (that \(dqcommand\(dq and \(dqdirectory\(dq) is the completion description. It\(aqs just a short hint to explain what kind of argument it is.
.sp
fish can also complete many commands, like git branches:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> git merge pr\fBtab\fP => git merge prompt_designer
> git checkout b\fBtab\fP
builtin_list_io_merge (Branch)  builtin_set_color (Branch) busted_events (Tag)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Try hitting tab and see what fish can do!
.SS Variables
.sp
Like other shells, a dollar sign followed by a variable name is replaced with the value of that variable:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> echo My home directory is $HOME
My home directory is /home/tutorial
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is known as variable substitution, and it also happens in double quotes, but not single quotes:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> echo \(dqMy current directory is $PWD\(dq
My current directory is /home/tutorial
> echo \(aqMy current directory is $PWD\(aq
My current directory is $PWD
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Unlike other shells, fish has an ordinary command to set variables: \fBset\fP, which takes a variable name, and then its value.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> set name \(aqMister Noodle\(aq
> echo $name
Mister Noodle
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
(Notice the quotes: without them, \fBMister\fP and \fBNoodle\fP would have been separate arguments, and \fB$name\fP would have been made into a list of two elements.)
.sp
Unlike other shells, variables are not further split after substitution:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> mkdir $name
> ls
Mister Noodle
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In bash, this would have created two directories \(dqMister\(dq and \(dqNoodle\(dq. In fish, it created only one: the variable had the value \(dqMister Noodle\(dq, so that is the argument that was passed to \fBmkdir\fP, spaces and all.
.sp
You can erase (or \(dqdelete\(dq) a variable with \fB\-e\fP or \fB\-\-erase\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> set \-e MyVariable
> env | grep MyVariable
(no output)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For more, see Variable expansion \%<#\:expand-variable>\&.
.SS Exports (Shell Variables)
.sp
Sometimes you need to have a variable available to an external command, often as a setting. For example many programs like \fBgit\fP or \fBman\fP read the \fB$PAGER\fP variable to figure out your preferred pager (the program that lets you scroll text). Other variables used like this include \fB$BROWSER\fP, \fB$LANG\fP (to configure your language) and \fB$PATH\fP\&. You\(aqll note these are written in ALLCAPS, but that\(aqs just a convention.
.sp
To give a variable to an external command, it needs to be \(dqexported\(dq. This is done with a flag to \fBset\fP, either \fB\-\-export\fP or just \fB\-x\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> set \-x MyVariable SomeValue
> env | grep MyVariable
MyVariable=SomeValue
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
It can also be unexported with \fB\-\-unexport\fP or \fB\-u\fP\&.
.sp
This works the other way around as well! If fish is started by something else, it inherits that parents exported variables. So if your terminal emulator starts fish, and it exports \fB$LANG\fP set to \fBen_US.UTF\-8\fP, fish will receive that setting. And whatever started your terminal emulator also gave \fIit\fP some variables that it will then pass on unless it specifically decides not to. This is how fish usually receives the values for things like \fB$LANG\fP, \fB$PATH\fP and \fB$TERM\fP, without you having to specify them again.
.sp
Exported variables can be local or global or universal \- \(dqexported\(dq is not a scope \%<#\:variables-scope>! Usually you\(aqd make them global via \fBset \-gx MyVariable SomeValue\fP\&.
.sp
For more, see Exporting variables \%<#\:variables-export>\&.
.SS Lists
.sp
The \fBset\fP command above used quotes to ensure that \fBMister Noodle\fP was one argument. If it had been two arguments, then \fBname\fP would have been a list of length 2.  In fact, all variables in fish are really lists, that can contain any number of values, or none at all.
.sp
Some variables, like \fB$PWD\fP, only have one value. By convention, we talk about that variable\(aqs value, but we really mean its first (and only) value.
.sp
Other variables, like \fB$PATH\fP, really do have multiple values. During variable expansion, the variable expands to become multiple arguments:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> echo $PATH
/usr/bin /bin /usr/sbin /sbin /usr/local/bin
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Variables whose name ends in \(dqPATH\(dq are automatically split on colons to become lists. They are joined using colons when exported to subcommands. This is for compatibility with other tools, which expect $PATH to use colons. You can also explicitly add this quirk to a variable with \fBset \-\-path\fP, or remove it with \fBset \-\-unpath\fP\&.
.sp
Lists cannot contain other lists: there is no recursion.  A variable is a list of strings, full stop.
.sp
Get the length of a list with \fBcount\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> count $PATH
5
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can append (or prepend) to a list by setting the list to itself, with some additional arguments. Here we append /usr/local/bin to $PATH:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> set PATH $PATH /usr/local/bin
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can access individual elements with square brackets. Indexing starts at 1 from the beginning, and \-1 from the end:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX

You can also access ranges of elements, known as \(dqslices\(dq:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> echo $PATH[1..2]
/usr/bin /bin
> echo $PATH[\-1..2]
/usr/local/bin /sbin /usr/sbin /bin
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can iterate over a list (or a slice) with a for loop:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
for val in $PATH
  echo \(dqentry: $val\(dq
end
# Will print:
# entry: /usr/bin/
# entry: /bin
# entry: /usr/sbin
# entry: /sbin
# entry: /usr/local/bin
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
One particular bit is that you can use lists like Brace expansion \%<#\:expand-brace>\&. If you attach another string to a list, it\(aqll combine every element of the list with the string:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> set mydirs /usr/bin /bin
> echo $mydirs/fish # this is just like {/usr/bin,/bin}/fish
/usr/bin/fish /bin/fish
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This also means that, if the list is empty, there will be no argument:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> set empty # no argument
> echo $empty/this_is_gone # prints an empty line
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you quote the list, it will be used as one string and so you\(aqll get one argument even if it is empty.
.sp

For more on combining lists with strings (or even other lists), see cartesian products \%<#\:cartesian-product> and Variable expansion \%<#\:expand-variable>\&.
.SS Wildcards
.sp
Fish supports the familiar wildcard \fB*\fP\&. To list all JPEG files:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> ls *.jpg
lena.jpg
meena.jpg
santa maria.jpg
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can include multiple wildcards:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> ls l*.p*
lena.png
lesson.pdf
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The recursive wildcard \fB**\fP searches directories recursively:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> ls /var/**.log
/var/log/system.log
/var/run/sntp.log
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If that directory traversal is taking a long time, you can \fBctrl\fP\-\fBc\fP out of it.
.sp
For more, see Wildcards \%<#\:expand-wildcard>\&.
.SS Pipes and Redirections
.sp
You can pipe between commands with the usual vertical bar:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> echo hello world | wc
      1       2      12
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
stdin and stdout can be redirected via the familiar \fB<\fP and \fB>\fP\&. stderr is redirected with a \fB2>\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> grep fish < /etc/shells > ~/output.txt 2> ~/errors.txt
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To redirect stdout and stderr into one file, you can use \fB&>\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> make &> make_output.txt
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For more, see Input and output redirections \%<#\:redirects> and Pipes \%<#\:pipes>\&.
.SS Command Substitutions
.sp
Command substitutions use the output of one command as an argument to another. Unlike other shells, fish does not use backticks \(ga\(ga for command substitutions. Instead, it uses parentheses with or without a dollar:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> echo In (pwd), running $(uname)
In /home/tutorial, running FreeBSD
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
A common idiom is to capture the output of a command in a variable:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> set os (uname)
> echo $os
Linux
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Command substitutions without a dollar are not expanded within quotes, so the version with a dollar is simpler:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> touch \(dqtesting_$(date +%s).txt\(dq
> ls *.txt
testing_1360099791.txt
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Unlike other shells, fish does not split command substitutions on any whitespace (like spaces or tabs), only newlines. Usually this is a big help because unix commands operate on a line\-by\-line basis. Sometimes it can be an issue with commands like \fBpkg\-config\fP that print what is meant to be multiple arguments on a single line. To split it on spaces too, use \fBstring split\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> printf \(aq%s\en\(aq (pkg\-config \-\-libs gio\-2.0)
\-lgio\-2.0 \-lgobject\-2.0 \-lglib\-2.0
> printf \(aq%s\en\(aq (pkg\-config \-\-libs gio\-2.0 | string split \-n \(dq \(dq)
\-lgio\-2.0
\-lgobject\-2.0
\-lglib\-2.0
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you need a command substitutions output as one argument, without any splits, use quoted command substitution:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> echo \(dqfirst line
second line\(dq > myfile
> set myfile \(dq$(cat myfile)\(dq
> printf \(aq|%s|\(aq $myfile
|first line
second line|
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For more, see Command substitution \%<#\:expand-command-substitution>\&.
.SS Separating Commands (Semicolon)
.sp
Like other shells, fish allows multiple commands either on separate lines or the same line.
.sp
To write them on the same line, use the semicolon (\(dq;\(dq). That means the following two examples are equivalent:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
echo fish; echo chips

# or
echo fish
echo chips
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is useful interactively to enter multiple commands. In a script it\(aqs easier to read if the commands are on separate lines.
.SS Exit Status
.sp
When a command exits, it returns a status code as a non\-negative integer (that\(aqs a whole number >= 0).
.sp
Unlike other shells, fish stores the exit status of the last command in \fB$status\fP instead of \fB$?\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> false
> echo $status
1
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This indicates how the command fared \- 0 usually means success, while the others signify kinds of failure. For instance fish\(aqs \fBset \-\-query\fP returns the number of variables it queried that weren\(aqt set \- \fBset \-\-query PATH\fP usually returns 0, \fBset \-\-query arglbargl boogagoogoo\fP usually returns 2.
.sp
There is also a \fB$pipestatus\fP list variable for the exit statuses [1] of processes in a pipe.
.sp
For more, see The status variable \%<#\:variables-status>\&.

.SS Combiners (And, Or, Not)
.sp
fish supports the familiar \fB&&\fP and \fB||\fP to combine commands, and \fB!\fP to negate them:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> ./configure && make && sudo make install
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Here, \fBmake\fP is only executed if \fB\&./configure\fP succeeds (returns 0), and \fBsudo make install\fP is only executed if both \fB\&./configure\fP and \fBmake\fP succeed.
.sp
fish also supports and \%<>, or \%<>, and not \%<>\&. The first two are job modifiers and have lower precedence. Example usage:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> cp file1 file1_bak && cp file2 file2_bak; and echo \(dqBackup successful\(dq; or echo \(dqBackup failed\(dq
Backup failed
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
As mentioned in the section on the semicolon, this can also be written in multiple lines, like so:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
cp file1 file1_bak && cp file2 file2_bak
and echo \(dqBackup successful\(dq
or echo \(dqBackup failed\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Conditionals (If, Else, Switch)
.sp
Use if \%<> and else \%<> to conditionally execute code, based on the exit status of a command.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
if grep fish /etc/shells
    echo Found fish
else if grep bash /etc/shells
    echo Found bash
else
    echo Got nothing
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To compare strings or numbers or check file properties (whether a file exists or is writeable and such), use test \%<>, like
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
if test \(dq$fish\(dq = \(dqflounder\(dq
    echo FLOUNDER
end

# or

if test \(dq$number\(dq \-gt 5
    echo $number is greater than five
else
    echo $number is five or less
end

# or

# This test is true if the path /etc/hosts exists
# \- it could be a file or directory or symlink (or possibly something else).
if test \-e /etc/hosts
    echo We most likely have a hosts file
else
    echo We do not have a hosts file
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Combiners can also be used to make more complex conditions, like
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
if command \-sq fish; and grep fish /etc/shells
    echo fish is installed and configured
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For even more complex conditions, use begin \%<> and end \%<> to group parts of them.
.sp
There is also a switch \%<> command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
switch (uname)
case Linux
    echo Hi Tux!
case Darwin
    echo Hi Hexley!
case FreeBSD NetBSD DragonFly
    echo Hi Beastie!
case \(aq*\(aq
    echo Hi, stranger!
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
As you see, case \%<> does not fall through, and can accept multiple arguments or (quoted) wildcards.
.sp
For more, see Conditions \%<#\:syntax-conditional>\&.
.SS Functions
.sp
A fish function is a list of commands, which may optionally take arguments. Unlike other shells, arguments are not passed in \(dqnumbered variables\(dq like \fB$1\fP, but instead in a single list \fB$argv\fP\&. To create a function, use the function \%<> builtin:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
function say_hello
    echo Hello $argv
end
say_hello
# prints: Hello
say_hello everybody!
# prints: Hello everybody!
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Unlike other shells, fish does not have aliases or special prompt syntax. Functions take their place. [2]
.sp
You can list the names of all functions with the functions \%<> builtin (note the plural!). fish starts out with a number of functions:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> functions
N_, abbr, alias, bg, cd, cdh, contains_seq, dirh, dirs, disown, down\-or\-search, edit_command_buffer, export, fg, fish_add_path, fish_breakpoint_prompt, fish_clipboard_copy, fish_clipboard_paste, fish_config, fish_default_key_bindings, fish_default_mode_prompt, fish_git_prompt, fish_hg_prompt, fish_hybrid_key_bindings, fish_indent, fish_is_root_user, fish_job_summary, fish_key_reader, fish_md5, fish_mode_prompt, fish_npm_helper, fish_opt, fish_print_git_action, fish_print_hg_root, fish_prompt, fish_sigtrap_handler, fish_svn_prompt, fish_title, fish_update_completions, fish_vcs_prompt, fish_vi_cursor, fish_vi_key_bindings, funced, funcsave, grep, help, history, hostname, isatty, kill, la, ll, ls, man, nextd, open, popd, prevd, prompt_hostname, prompt_pwd, psub, pushd, realpath, seq, setenv, suspend, trap, type, umask, up\-or\-search, vared, wait
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can see the source for any function by passing its name to \fBfunctions\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> functions ls
function ls \-\-description \(aqList contents of directory\(aq
    command ls \-G $argv
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For more, see Functions \%<#\:syntax-function>\&.
.IP [2] 5
There is a function called alias \%<>, but it\(aqs just a shortcut to make functions. fish also provides abbreviations \%<#\:abbreviations>, through the abbr \%<> command.
.SS Loops
.sp
While loops:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
while true
    echo \(dqLoop forever\(dq
end
# Prints:
# Loop forever
# Loop forever
# Loop forever
# yes, this really will loop forever. Unless you abort it with ctrl\-c.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For loops can be used to iterate over a list. For example, a list of files:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
for file in *.txt
    cp $file $file.bak
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Iterating over a list of numbers can be done with \fBseq\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
for x in (seq 5)
    touch file_$x.txt
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For more, see Loops and blocks \%<#\:syntax-loops-and-blocks>\&.
.SS Prompt
.sp
Unlike other shells, there is no prompt variable like \fBPS1\fP\&. To display your prompt, fish executes the fish_prompt \%<> function and uses its output as the prompt. And if it exists, fish also executes the fish_right_prompt \%<> function and uses its output as the right prompt.
.sp
You can define your own prompt from the command line:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> function fish_prompt; echo \(dqNew Prompt % \(dq; end
New Prompt % _
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Then, if you are happy with it, you can save it to disk by typing \fBfuncsave fish_prompt\fP\&. This saves the prompt in \fB~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish\fP\&. (Or, if you want, you can create that file manually from the start.)
.sp
Multiple lines are OK. Colors can be set via set_color \%<> by passing it named ANSI colors, or hex RGB values:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
function fish_prompt
    set_color purple
    date \(dq+%m/%d/%y\(dq
    set_color FF0000
    echo (pwd) \(aq>\(aq (set_color normal)
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This prompt would look like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
02/06/13
/home/tutorial > _
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
See also Writing your own prompt \%<>\&.
.sp
You can choose among sample prompts by running \fBfish_config\fP for a web UI or \fBfish_config prompt\fP for a simpler version inside your terminal.
.SS $PATH
.sp
\fB$PATH\fP is an environment variable containing the directories that fish searches for commands. Unlike other shells, $PATH is a list, not a colon\-delimited string.
.sp
Fish takes care to set \fB$PATH\fP to a default, but typically it is just inherited from fish\(aqs parent process and is set to a value that makes sense for the system \- see Exports\&.
.sp
To prepend /usr/local/bin and /usr/sbin to \fB$PATH\fP, you can write:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> set PATH /usr/local/bin /usr/sbin $PATH
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To remove /usr/local/bin from \fB$PATH\fP, you can write:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> set PATH (string match \-v /usr/local/bin $PATH)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For compatibility with other shells and external commands, $PATH is a path variable \%<#\:variables-path>, and so will be joined with colons (not spaces) when you quote it:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> echo \(dq$PATH\(dq
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
and it will be exported like that, and when fish starts it splits the $PATH it receives into a list on colon.
.sp
You can do so directly in \fBconfig.fish\fP, like you might do in other shells with \fB\&.profile\fP\&. See this example\&.
.sp
A faster way is to use the fish_add_path \%<> function, which adds given directories to the path if they aren\(aqt already included. It does this by modifying the \fB$fish_user_paths\fP universal variable, which is automatically prepended to \fB$PATH\fP\&. For example, to permanently add \fB/usr/local/bin\fP to your \fB$PATH\fP, you could write:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> fish_add_path /usr/local/bin
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The advantage is that you don\(aqt have to go mucking around in files: just run this once at the command line, and it will affect the current session and all future instances too. You can also add this line to config.fish, as it only adds the component if necessary.
.sp
Or you can modify $fish_user_paths yourself, but you should be careful \fInot\fP to append to it unconditionally in config.fish, or it will grow longer and longer.
.SS Startup (Where\(aqs .bashrc?)
.sp
Fish starts by executing commands in \fB~/.config/fish/config.fish\fP\&. You can create it if it does not exist.
.sp
It is possible to directly create functions and variables in \fBconfig.fish\fP file, using the commands shown above. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> cat ~/.config/fish/config.fish

set \-x PATH $PATH /sbin/

function ll
    ls \-lh $argv
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
However, it is more common and efficient to use  autoloading functions and universal variables.
.sp
If you want to organize your configuration, fish also reads commands in .fish files in \fB~/.config/fish/conf.d/\fP\&. See Configuration Files \%<#\:configuration> for the details.
.SS Autoloading Functions
.sp
When fish encounters a command, it attempts to autoload a function for that command, by looking for a file with the name of that command in \fB~/.config/fish/functions/\fP\&.
.sp
For example, if you wanted to have a function \fBll\fP, you would add a text file \fBll.fish\fP to \fB~/.config/fish/functions\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> cat ~/.config/fish/functions/ll.fish
function ll
    ls \-lh $argv
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is the preferred way to define your prompt as well:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> cat ~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish
function fish_prompt
    echo (pwd) \(dq> \(dq
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
See the documentation for funced \%<> and funcsave \%<> for ways to create these files automatically, and $fish_function_path \%<#\:syntax-function-autoloading> to control their location.
.SS Universal Variables
.sp
A universal variable is a variable whose value is shared across all instances of fish, now and in the future – even after a reboot. You can make a variable universal with \fBset \-U\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> set \-U EDITOR vim
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now in another shell:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> echo $EDITOR
vim
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You only need to set universal variables once interactively. There is no need to add them to your config files \%<#\:configuration>\&. For more details, see Universal Variables \%<#\:variables-universal>\&.
.SS Ready for more?
.sp
If you want to learn more about fish, there is lots of detailed documentation \%<#\:intro>, the official gitter channel \%<https://\:gitter\:.im/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell>, an official mailing list \%<https://\:lists\:.sourceforge\:.net/\:lists/\:listinfo/\:fish-users>, and the github page \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/>\&.
.SS Writing your own completions
.sp
To specify a completion, use the \fBcomplete\fP command. \fBcomplete\fP takes as a parameter the name of the command to specify a completion for. For example, to add a completion for the program \fBmyprog\fP, start the completion command with \fBcomplete \-c myprog ...\fP
.sp
For a complete description of the various switches accepted by the \fBcomplete\fP command, see the documentation for the complete \%<> builtin, or write \fBcomplete \-\-help\fP inside the \fBfish\fP shell.
.sp
To provide a list of possible completions for myprog, use the \fB\-a\fP switch. If \fBmyprog\fP accepts the arguments start and stop, this can be specified as \fBcomplete \-c myprog \-a \(aqstart stop\(aq\fP\&. The argument to the \fB\-a\fP switch is always a single string. At completion time, it will be tokenized on spaces and tabs, and variable expansion, command substitution and other forms of parameter expansion will take place:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# If myprog can list the valid outputs with the list\-outputs subcommand:
complete \-c myprog \-l output \-a \(aq(myprog list\-outputs)\(aq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBfish\fP has a special syntax to support specifying switches accepted by a command. The switches \fB\-s\fP, \fB\-l\fP and \fB\-o\fP are used to specify a short switch (single character, such as \fB\-l\fP), a gnu style long switch (such as \fB\-\-color\fP) and an old\-style long switch (with one \fB\-\fP, like \fB\-shuffle\fP), respectively. If the command \(aqmyprog\(aq has an option that can be written as \fB\-o\fP or \fB\-\-output\fP, that is:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
complete \-c myprog \-s o \-l output
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If this option takes an optional argument, you would also add \fB\-\-argument\fP or \fB\-a\fP, and give that the possible arguments:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
complete \-c myprog \-s o \-l output \-a \(dqyes no\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This offers the arguments \(dqyes\(dq and \(dqno\(dq for:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> myprog \-o<TAB>
> myprog \-\-output=<TAB>
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
By default, option arguments are \fIoptional\fP, so the candidates are only offered directly attached like that, so they aren\(aqt given in this case:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> myprog \-o <TAB>
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Usually options \fIrequire\fP a parameter, so you would give \fB\-\-require\-parameter\fP / \fB\-r\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
complete \-c myprog \-s o \-l output \-ra \(dqyes no\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
which offers yes/no in these cases:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
> myprog \-o<TAB>
> myprog \-\-output=<TAB>
> myprog \-o <TAB>
> myprog \-\-output <TAB>
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Fish will also offer files by default, in addition to the arguments you specified. You would either inhibit file completion for a single option:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
complete \-c myprog \-s o \-l output \-\-no\-files \-ra \(dqyes no\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
or with a specific condition:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
complete \-c myprog \-f \-\-condition \(aq__fish_seen_subcommand_from somesubcommand\(aq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
or you can disable file completions globally for the command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
complete \-c myprog \-f
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you have disabled them globally, you can enable them just for a specific condition or option with the \fB\-\-force\-files\fP / \fB\-F\fP option:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# Disable files by default
complete \-c myprog \-f
# but reenable them for \-\-config\-file
complete \-c myprog \-l config\-file \-\-force\-files \-r

For examples of how to write your own complex completions, study the completions in \fB/usr/share/fish/completions\fP\&. (The exact path depends on your chosen installation prefix and may be slightly different)
.SS Useful functions for writing completions
.sp
\fBfish\fP ships with several functions that may be useful when writing command\-specific completions. Most of these function names begin with the string \fB__fish_\fP\&. Such functions are internal to \fBfish\fP and their name and interface may change in future fish versions. A few of these functions are described here.
.sp
Functions beginning with the string \fB__fish_print_\fP print a newline separated list of strings. For example, \fB__fish_print_filesystems\fP prints a list of all known file systems. Functions beginning with \fB__fish_complete_\fP print out a newline separated list of completions with descriptions. The description is separated from the completion by a tab character.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB__fish_complete_directories STRING DESCRIPTION\fP performs path completion on STRING, allowing only directories, and giving them the description DESCRIPTION.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB__fish_complete_path STRING DESCRIPTION\fP performs path completion on STRING, giving them the description DESCRIPTION.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB__fish_complete_groups\fP prints a list of all user groups with the groups members as description.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB__fish_complete_pids\fP prints a list of all processes IDs with the command name as description.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB__fish_complete_suffix SUFFIX\fP performs file completion but sorts files ending in SUFFIX first. This is useful in conjunction with \fBcomplete \-\-keep\-order\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB__fish_complete_users\fP prints a list of all users with their full name as description.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB__fish_print_filesystems\fP prints a list of all known file systems. Currently, this is a static list, and not dependent on what file systems the host operating system actually understands.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB__fish_print_hostnames\fP prints a list of all known hostnames. This function searches the fstab for nfs servers, ssh for known hosts and checks the \fB/etc/hosts\fP file.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB__fish_print_interfaces\fP prints a list of all known network interfaces.
.UNINDENT
.SS Where to put completions
.sp
Completions can be defined on the commandline or in a configuration file, but they can also be automatically loaded. Fish automatically searches through any directories in the list variable \fB$fish_complete_path\fP, and any completions defined are automatically loaded when needed. A completion file must have a filename consisting of the name of the command to complete and the suffix \fB\&.fish\fP\&.
.sp
By default, Fish searches the following for completions, using the first available file that it finds:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A directory for end\-users to keep their own completions, usually \fB~/.config/fish/completions\fP (controlled by the \fBXDG_CONFIG_HOME\fP environment variable);
.IP \(bu 2
A directory for systems administrators to install completions for all users on the system, usually \fB/etc/fish/completions\fP;
.IP \(bu 2
A user\-specified directory for third\-party vendor completions, usually \fB~/.local/share/fish/vendor_completions.d\fP (controlled by the \fBXDG_DATA_HOME\fP environment variable);
.IP \(bu 2
A directory for third\-party software vendors to ship their own completions for their software, usually \fB/usr/share/fish/vendor_completions.d\fP;
.IP \(bu 2
The completions shipped with fish, usually installed in \fB/usr/share/fish/completions\fP; and
.IP \(bu 2
Completions automatically generated from the operating system\(aqs manual, usually stored in \fB~/.cache/fish/generated_completions\fP (controlled by \fBXDG_CACHE_HOME\fP environment variable).
.UNINDENT
.sp
These paths are controlled by parameters set at build, install, or run time, and may vary from the defaults listed above.
.sp
This wide search may be confusing. If you are unsure, your completions probably belong in \fB~/.config/fish/completions\fP\&.
.sp
If you have written new completions for a common Unix command, please consider sharing your work by submitting it via the instructions in Further help and development \%<#\:more-help>\&.
.sp
If you are developing another program and would like to ship completions with your program, install them to the \(dqvendor\(dq completions directory. As this path may vary from system to system, the \fBpkgconfig\fP framework should be used to discover this path with the output of \fBpkg\-config \-\-variable completionsdir fish\fP\&.
.SS Writing your own prompt
.sp
\fBWarning:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This document uses formatting to show what a prompt would look like. If you are viewing this in the man page,
you probably want to switch to looking at the html version instead. Run \fBhelp custom\-prompt\fP to view it in a web browser.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Fish ships a number of prompts that you can view with the fish_config \%<> command, and many users have shared their prompts online.
.sp
However, you can also write your own, or adjust an existing prompt. This is a good way to get used to fish\(aqs scripting language \%<>\&.
.sp
Unlike other shells, fish\(aqs prompt is built by running a function \- fish_prompt \%<>\&. Or, more specifically, three functions:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
fish_prompt \%<>, which is the main prompt function
.IP \(bu 2
fish_right_prompt \%<>, which is shown on the right side of the terminal.
.IP \(bu 2
fish_mode_prompt \%<>, which is shown if vi mode \%<#\:vi-mode> is used.
.UNINDENT
.sp
These functions are run, and whatever they print is displayed as the prompt (minus one trailing newline).
.sp
Here, we will just be writing a simple fish_prompt.
.SS Our first prompt
.sp
Let\(aqs look at a very simple example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
function fish_prompt
    echo $PWD \(aq>\(aq
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This prints the current working directory (\fBPWD\fP \%<#\:envvar-PWD>) and a \fB>\fP symbol to show where the prompt ends. The \fB>\fP is quoted \%<#\:quotes> because otherwise it would signify a redirection \%<#\:redirects>\&.
.sp
Because we\(aqve used echo \%<>, it adds spaces between the two so it ends up looking like (assuming \fB_\fP is your cursor):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
/home/tutorial >_
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Formatting
.sp
\fBecho\fP adds spaces between its arguments. If you don\(aqt want those, you can use string join \%<> like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
function fish_prompt
    string join \(aq\(aq \-\- $PWD \(aq>\(aq
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fB\-\-\fP indicates to \fBstring\fP that no options can come after it, in case we extend this with something that can start with a \fB\-\fP\&.
.sp
There are other ways to remove the space, including \fBecho \-s\fP and printf \%<>\&.
.SS Adding color
.sp
This prompt is functional, but a bit boring. We could add some color.
.sp
Fortunately, fish offers the set_color \%<> command, so you can do:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
echo (set_color red)foo
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBset_color\fP can also handle RGB colors like \fBset_color 23b455\fP, and other formatting options including bold and italics.
.sp
So, taking our previous prompt and adding some color:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
function fish_prompt
    string join \(aq\(aq \-\- (set_color green) $PWD (set_color normal) \(aq>\(aq
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
A \(dqnormal\(dq color tells the terminal to go back to its normal formatting options.
.sp
\fBset_color\fP works by producing an escape sequence, which is a special piece of text that terminals
interpret as instructions \- for example, to change color. So \fBset_color red\fP produces the same
effect as:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
echo \ee\e[31m
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Although you can write your own escape sequences by hand, it\(aqs much easier to use \fBset_color\fP\&.
.SS Shortening the working directory
.sp
This is fine, but our \fBPWD\fP \%<#\:envvar-PWD> can be a bit long, and we are typically only interested in the last few directories. We can shorten this with the prompt_pwd \%<> helper that will give us a shortened working directory:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
function fish_prompt
    string join \(aq\(aq \-\- (set_color green) (prompt_pwd) (set_color normal) \(aq>\(aq
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBprompt_pwd\fP takes options to control how much to shorten. For instance, if we want to display the last two directories, we\(aqd use \fBprompt_pwd \-\-full\-length\-dirs 2\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
function fish_prompt
    string join \(aq\(aq \-\- (set_color green) (prompt_pwd \-\-full\-length\-dirs 2) (set_color normal) \(aq>\(aq
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
With a current directory of \(dq/home/tutorial/Music/Lena Raine/Oneknowing\(dq, this would print
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
~/M/Lena Raine/Oneknowing>_
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Status
.sp
One important bit of information that every command returns is the status \%<#\:variables-status>\&. This is a whole number from 0 to 255, and usually it is used as an error code \- 0 if the command returned successfully, or a number from 1 to 255 if not.
.sp
It\(aqs useful to display this in your prompt, but showing it when it\(aqs 0 seems kind of wasteful.
.sp
First of all, since every command (except for set \%<>) changes the status, you need to store it for later use as the first thing in your prompt. Use a local variable \%<#\:variables-scope> so it will be confined to your prompt function:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set \-l last_status $status
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And after that, you can set a string if it is not zero:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# Prompt status only if it\(aqs not 0
set \-l stat
if test $last_status \-ne 0
    set stat (set_color red)\(dq[$last_status]\(dq(set_color normal)
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And to print it, we add it to our \fBstring join\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
string join \(aq\(aq \-\- (set_color green) (prompt_pwd) (set_color normal) $stat \(aq>\(aq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If \fB$last_status\fP was 0, \fB$stat\fP is empty, and so it will simply disappear.
.sp
So our entire prompt is now:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
function fish_prompt
    set \-l last_status $status
    # Prompt status only if it\(aqs not 0
    set \-l stat
    if test $last_status \-ne 0
        set stat (set_color red)\(dq[$last_status]\(dq(set_color normal)
    end

    string join \(aq\(aq \-\- (set_color green) (prompt_pwd) (set_color normal) $stat \(aq>\(aq
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And it looks like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
~/M/L/Oneknowing>false
~/M/L/Oneknowing[1]>_
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
after we run \fBfalse\fP (which returns 1).
.SS Transient prompt
.sp
To enable transient prompt functionality, set the \fBfish_transient_prompt\fP \%<#\:envvar-fish_transient_prompt> variable to 1:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set \-g fish_transient_prompt 1
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
With this set, fish re\-runs prompt functions with a \fB\-\-final\-rendering\fP argument before running a commandline.
So you can use it to declutter your old prompts. For example if you want to see only the current directory name when you scroll up:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
function fish_prompt
    set \-l last_status $status
    set \-l stat
    set \-l pwd
    # Check if it\(aqs a transient or final prompt
    if contains \-\- \-\-final\-rendering $argv
        set pwd (path basename $PWD)
    else
        set pwd (prompt_pwd)
        # Prompt status only if it\(aqs not 0
        if test $last_status \-ne 0
            set stat (set_color red)\(dq[$last_status]\(dq(set_color normal)
        end
    end

    string join \(aq\(aq \-\- (set_color green) $pwd (set_color normal) $stat \(aq>\(aq
end
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now running two commands in the same directory could result in this screen:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
Oneknowing>false
~/M/L/Oneknowing[1]>_
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Save the prompt
.sp
Once you are happy with your prompt, you can save it with \fBfuncsave fish_prompt\fP (see funcsave \- save the definition of a function to the user\(aqs autoload directory \%<>) or write it to ~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish yourself.
.sp
If you want to edit it again, open that file or use \fBfunced fish_prompt\fP (see funced \- edit a function interactively \%<>).
.SS Where to go from here?
.sp
We have now built a simple but working and usable prompt, but of course more can be done.

.SS Design
.sp
This is a description of the design principles that have been used to design fish. The fish design has three high level goals. These are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Everything that can be done in other shell languages should be possible to do in fish, though fish may rely on external commands in doing so.
.IP 2. 3
Fish should be user\-friendly, but not at the expense of expressiveness. Most tradeoffs between power and ease of use can be avoided with careful design.
.IP 3. 3
Whenever possible without breaking the above goals, fish should follow POSIX.
.UNINDENT
.sp
To achieve these high\-level goals, the fish design relies on a number of more specific design principles. These are presented below, together with a rationale and a few examples for each.
.SS The law of orthogonality
.sp
The shell language should have a small set of orthogonal features. Any situation where two features are related but not identical, one of them should be removed, and the other should be made powerful and general enough to handle all common use cases of either feature.
.sp
Rationale:
Related features make the language larger, which makes it harder to learn. It also increases the size of the source code, making the program harder to maintain and update.
.sp
Examples:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Here documents are too similar to using echo inside of a pipeline.
.IP \(bu 2
Subshells, command substitution and process substitution are strongly related. \fBfish\fP only supports command substitution, the others can be achieved either using a block or the psub shellscript function.
.IP \(bu 2
Having both aliases and functions is confusing, especially since both of them have limitations and problems. \fBfish\fP functions have none of the drawbacks of either syntax.
.IP \(bu 2
The many Posix quoting styles are silly, especially \fB$\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.SS The law of responsiveness
.sp
The shell should attempt to remain responsive to the user at all times, even in the face of contended or unresponsive filesystems. It is only acceptable to block in response to a user initiated action, such as running a command.
.sp
Rationale:
Bad performance increases user\-facing complexity, because it trains users to recognize and route around slow use cases. It is also incredibly frustrating.
.sp
Examples:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Features like syntax highlighting and autosuggestions must perform all of their disk I/O asynchronously.
.IP \(bu 2
Startup should minimize forks and disk I/O, so that fish can be started even if the system is under load.
.UNINDENT
.SS Configurability is the root of all evil
.sp
Every configuration option in a program is a place where the program is too stupid to figure out for itself what the user really wants, and should be considered a failure of both the program and the programmer who implemented it.
.sp
Rationale:
Different configuration options are a nightmare to maintain, since the number of potential bugs caused by specific configuration combinations quickly becomes an issue. Configuration options often imply assumptions about the code which change when reimplementing the code, causing issues with backwards compatibility. But mostly, configuration options should be avoided since they simply should not exist, as the program should be smart enough to do what is best, or at least a good enough approximation of it.
.sp
Examples:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Fish allows the user to set various syntax highlighting colors. This is needed because fish does not know what colors the terminal uses by default, which might make some things unreadable. The proper solution would be for text color preferences to be defined centrally by the user for all programs, and for the terminal emulator to send these color properties to fish.
.IP \(bu 2
Fish does not allow you to set the number of history entries, different language substyles or any number of other common shell configuration options.
.UNINDENT
.sp
A special note on the evils of configurability is the long list of very useful features found in some shells, that are not turned on by default. Both zsh and bash support command\-specific completions, but no such completions are shipped with bash by default, and they are turned off by default in zsh. Other features that zsh supports that are disabled by default include tab\-completion of strings containing wildcards, a sane completion pager and a history file.
.SS The law of user focus
.sp
When designing a program, one should first think about how to make an intuitive and powerful program. Implementation issues should only be considered once a user interface has been designed.
.sp
Rationale:
This design rule is different than the others, since it describes how one should go about designing new features, not what the features should be. The problem with focusing on what can be done, and what is easy to do, is that too much of the implementation is exposed. This means that the user must know a great deal about the underlying system to be able to guess how the shell works, it also means that the language will often be rather low\-level.
.sp
Examples:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
There should only be one type of input to the shell, lists of commands. Loops, conditionals and variable assignments are all performed through regular commands.
.IP \(bu 2
The differences between built\-in commands and shellscript functions should be made as small as possible. Built\-ins and shellscript functions should have exactly the same types of argument expansion as other commands, should be possible to use in any position in a pipeline, and should support any I/O redirection.
.IP \(bu 2
Instead of forking when performing command substitution to provide a fake variable scope, all fish commands are performed from the same process, and fish instead supports true scoping.
.IP \(bu 2
All blocks end with the \fBend\fP built\-in.
.UNINDENT
.SS The law of discoverability
.sp
A program should be designed to make its features as easy as possible to discover for the user.
.sp
Rationale:
A program whose features are discoverable turns a new user into an expert in a shorter span of time, since the user will become an expert on the program simply by using it.
.sp
The main benefit of a graphical program over a command\-line\-based program is discoverability. In a graphical program, one can discover all the common features by simply looking at the user interface and guessing what the different buttons, menus and other widgets do. The traditional way to discover features in command\-line programs is through manual pages. This requires both that the user starts to use a different program, and then they remember the new information until the next time they use the same program.
.sp
Examples:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Everything should be tab\-completable, and every tab completion should have a description.
.IP \(bu 2
Every syntax error and error in a built\-in command should contain an error message describing what went wrong and a relevant help page. Whenever possible, errors should be flagged red by the syntax highlighter.
.IP \(bu 2
The help manual should be easy to read, easily available from the shell, complete and contain many examples
.IP \(bu 2
The language should be uniform, so that once the user understands the command/argument syntax, they will know the whole language, and be able to use tab\-completion to discover new features.

.sp
The self\-installing build type introduced in fish 4.0 has been changed (#11143 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:11143>).
Now fish built with embedded data will just read the data straight from its own binary or write it out to temporary files when necessary, instead of requiring an installation step on start.
That means it is now possible to build fish as a single file and copy it to any system with a compatible CPU architecture, including as a different user, without extracting any files.
As before, this is the default when building via \fBcargo\fP, and disabled when building via CMake.
For packagers we continue to recommend CMake.
.sp
Note: When fish is built like this, the \fB__fish_data_dir\fP variable will be empty because that directory no longer has meaning.
You should generally not need these files.
For example, if you want to make sure that completions for \(dqfoo\(dq are loaded, use \fBcomplete \-C\(dqfoo \(dq >/dev/null\fP  instead).
The raw files are still exposed via status subcommands \%<#\:status-get-file>, mainly for fish\(aqs internal use, but you can also use them as a last resort.

.SS Changes to gettext localization
.sp
We replaced several parts of the gettext functionality with custom implementations (#11726 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:11726>).
Most notably, message extraction, which should now work reliably, and the runtime implementation, where we no longer dynamically link to gettext, but instead use our own implementation, whose behavior is similar to GNU gettext, with some minor deviations \%<>\&.
Our implementation now fully respects fish variables, so locale variables do not have to be exported for fish localizations to work.
They still have to be exported to inform other programs about language preferences.
The \fBLANGUAGE\fP \%<#\:envvar-LANGUAGE> environment variable is now treated as a path variable, meaning it is an implicitly colon\-separated list.
While we no longer have any runtime dependency on gettext, we still need gettext tools for building, most notably \fBmsgfmt\fP\&.
When building without \fBmsgfmt\fP available, localization will not work with the resulting executable.
Localization data is no longer sourced at runtime from MO files on the file system, but instead built into the executable.
This is always done, independently of the other data embedding, so all fish executables will have access to all message catalogs, regardless of the state of the file system.
Disabling our new \fBlocalize\-messages\fP cargo feature will cause fish to be built without localization support.
CMake builds can continue to use the \fBWITH_GETTEXT\fP option, with the same semantics as the \fBlocalize\-messages\fP feature.
The current implementation does not provide any configuration options for controlling which language catalogs are built into the executable (other than disabling them all).
As a workaround, you can delete files in the \fBpo\fP directory before building to exclude unwanted languages.

In addition, \fBfish_opt\fP has been modified to support such options by using the \fB\-\-multiple\-vals\fP together with \fB\-o\fP / \fB\-\-optional\-val\fP; \fB\-m\fP is also now acceptable as an abbreviation for \fB\-\-multiple\-vals\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_opt\fP no longer requires you give a short flag name when defining options, provided you give it a long flag name with more than one character.

This release of fish fixes a number of issues identified in fish 4.0.2:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
fish now properly inherits $PATH under Windows WSL2 (#11354 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:11354>).
.IP \(bu 2
Remote filesystems are detected properly again on non\-Linux systems.
.IP \(bu 2
the printf \%<> builtin no longer miscalculates width of multi\-byte characters (#11412 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:11412>).
.IP \(bu 2
For many years, fish has been \(dqrelocatable\(dq \-\- it was possible to move the entire \fBCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX\fP and fish would use paths relative to its binary.
Only gettext locale paths were still determined purely at compile time, which has been fixed.
.IP \(bu 2
the commandline \%<> builtin failed to print the commandline set by a \fBcommandline \-C\fP invocation, which broke some completion scripts.
This has been corrected (#11423 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:11423>).
.IP \(bu 2
To work around terminals that fail to parse Operating System Command (OSC) sequences, a temporary feature flag has been added.
It allows you to disable prompt marking (OSC 133) by running (once) \fBset \-Ua fish_features no\-mark\-prompt\fP and restarting fish (#11749 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:11749>).

A crash displaying multi\-line quoted command substitutions has been fixed (#11444 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:11444>).
.IP \(bu 2
Commands like \fBset fish_complete_path ...\fP accidentally disabled completion autoloading, which has been corrected.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnmcli\fP completions have been fixed to query network information dynamically instead of only when completing the first time.
.IP \(bu 2
Git completions no longer print an error when no \fIgit\-foo\fP executable is in \fBPATH\fP \%<#\:envvar-PATH>\&.
.IP \(bu 2
Custom completions like \fBcomplete foo \-l long \-xa ...\fP that use the output of \fBcommandline \-t\fP\&.
on a command\-line like \fBfoo \-\-long=\fP have been invalidated by a change in 4.0; the completion scripts have been adjusted accordingly (#11508 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:11508>).
.IP \(bu 2
Some completions were misinterpreted, which caused garbage to be displayed in the completion list. This has been fixed.

\fBalt\fP\-\fBleft\fP \fBalt\fP\-\fBright\fP were misinterpreted because they send unexpected sequences on some terminals; a workaround has been added.  (#11479 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:11479>).
.IP \(bu 2
Key bindings like \fBbind shift\-A\fP are no longer accepted; use \fBbind shift\-a\fP or \fBbind A\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
Key bindings like \fBbind shift\-a\fP take precedence over \fBbind A\fP when the key event included the shift modifier.
.IP \(bu 2
Bindings using shift with non\-ASCII letters (such as \fBctrl\fP\-\fBshift\fP\-\fBä\fP) are now supported.
.IP \(bu 2
Bindings with modifiers such as \fBbind ctrl\-w\fP work again on non\-Latin keyboard layouts such as a Russian one.
This is implemented by allowing key events such as \fBctrl\fP\-\fBц\fP to match bindings of the corresponding Latin key, using the kitty keyboard protocol\(aqs base layout key (#11520 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:11520>).

.sp
This release of fish fixes a number of issues identified in fish 4.0.1:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Completions are quoted, rather than backslash\-escaped, only if the completion is unambiguous. Continuing to edit the token is therefore easier (#11271 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:11271>). This changes the behavior introduced in 4.0.0 where all completions were quoted.
.IP \(bu 2
The warning when the terminfo database can\(aqt be found has been downgraded to a log message. fish will act as if the terminal behaves like xterm\-256color, which is correct for the vast majority of cases (#11277 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:11277>, #11290 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:11290>).

The Mercurial (\fBhg\fP) prompt can handle working directories that contain an embedded newline, rather than producing errors (#11348 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:11348>).
.IP \(bu 2
A number of crashes have been fixed.

.SS fish 4.0.0 (released February 27, 2025)
.sp
fish\(aqs core code has been ported from C++ to Rust (#9512 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:9512>). This means a large change in dependencies and how to build fish. However, there should be no direct impact on users. Packagers should see the For Distributors section at the end.
.SS Notable backwards\-incompatible changes
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
As part of a larger binding rework, \fBbind\fP gained a new key notation.
In most cases the old notation should keep working, but in rare cases you may have to change a \fBbind\fP invocation to use the new notation.
See below for details.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBctrl\fP\-\fBc\fP now calls a new bind function called \fBclear\-commandline\fP\&. The old behavior, which leaves a \(dq^C\(dq marker, is available as \fBcancel\-commandline\fP (#10935 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:10935>)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBrandom\fP will produce different values from previous versions of fish when used with the same seed, and will work more sensibly with small seed numbers.
The seed was never guaranteed to give the same result across systems,
so we do not expect this to have a large impact (#9593 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:9593>).
.IP \(bu 2
Variables in command position that expand to a subcommand keyword are now forbidden to fix a likely user error.
For example, \fBset editor command emacs; $editor\fP is no longer allowed (#10249 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:10249>).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfunctions \-\-handlers\fP will now list handlers in a different order.
Now it is definition order, first to last, where before it was last to first.
This was never specifically defined, and we recommend not relying on a specific order (#9944 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:9944>).
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBqmark\-noglob\fP feature, introduced in fish 3.0, is enabled by default. That means \fB?\fP will no longer act as a single\-character glob.
You can, for the time being, turn it back on by adding \fBno\-qmark\-noglob\fP to \fBfish_features\fP and restarting fish:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set \-Ua fish_features no\-qmark\-noglob
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The flag will eventually be made read\-only, making it impossible to turn off.
.IP \(bu 2
Terminals that fail to ignore unrecognized OSC or CSI sequences may display garbage. We know cool\-retro\-term and emacs\(aq ansi\-term are affected, but most mainstream terminals are not.
.IP \(bu 2
fish no longer searches directories from the Windows system/user \fB$PATH\fP environment variable for Linux executables. To execute Linux binaries by name (i.e. not with a relative or absolute path) from a Windows folder, make sure the \fB/mnt/c/...\fP path is explicitly added to \fB$fish_user_paths\fP and not just automatically appended to \fB$PATH\fP by \fBwsl.exe\fP (#10506 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:10506>).
.IP \(bu 2
Under Microsoft Windows Subsystem for Linux 1 (not WSL 2), backgrounded jobs that have not been disowned and do not terminate on their own after a \fBSIGHUP\fP + \fBSIGCONT\fP sequence will be explicitly killed by fish on exit (after the usual prompt to close or disown them) to work around a WSL 1 deficiency that sees backgrounded processes that run into \fBSIGTTOU\fP remain in a suspended state indefinitely (#5263 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:5263>). The workaround is to explicitly \fBdisown\fP processes you wish to outlive the shell session.

fish now requests XTerm\(aqs \fBmodifyOtherKeys\fP keyboard encoding and kitty keyboard protocol\(aqs \%<https://\:sw\:.kovidgoyal\:.net/\:kitty/\:keyboard-protocol/> progressive enhancements (#10359 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:10359>).
Depending on terminal support, this allows to binding more key combinations, including arbitrary combinations of modifiers \fBctrl\fP, \fBalt\fP and \fBshift\fP, and distinguishing (for example) \fBctrl\fP\-\fBi\fP from \fBtab\fP\&.
.sp
Additionally, \fBbind\fP now supports a human\-readable syntax in addition to byte sequences.
This includes modifier names, and names for keys like \fBenter\fP and \fBbackspace\fP\&.
For example
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBbind up \(aqdo something\(aq\fP binds the up\-arrow key instead of a two\-key sequence (\(dqu\(dq and then \(dqp\(dq)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBbind ctrl\-x,alt\-c \(aqdo something\(aq\fP binds a sequence of two keys.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Any key argument that starts with an ASCII control character (like \fB\ee\fP or \fB\ecX\fP) or is up to 3 characters long, not a named key, and does not contain \fB,\fP or \fB\-\fP will be interpreted in the old syntax to keep compatibility for the majority of bindings.
.sp
Keyboard protocols can be turned off by disabling the \(dqkeyboard\-protocols\(dq feature flag:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set \-Ua fish_features no\-keyboard\-protocols
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is a temporary measure to work around buggy terminals (#11056 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:11056>), which appear to be relatively rare.
Use this if something like \(dq=0\(dq or \(dq=5u\(dq appears in your commandline mysteriously.
.IP \(bu 2
fish can now be built as a self\-installing binary (#10367 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:10367>). That means it can be easily built on one system and copied to another, where it can extract supporting files.
To do this, run:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
cargo install \-\-path . # in a clone of the fish repository
# or \(gacargo build \-\-release\(ga and copy target/release/fish{,_indent,_key_reader} wherever you want
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The first time it runs interactively, it will extract all the data files to  \fB~/.local/share/fish/install/\fP\&. A specific path can be used for the data files with \fBfish \-\-install=PATH\fP To uninstall, remove the fish binaries and that directory.
.sp
This build system is experimental; the main build system, using \fBcmake\fP, remains the recommended approach for packaging and installation to a prefix.
.IP \(bu 2
A new function \fBfish_should_add_to_history\fP can be overridden to decide whether a command should be added to the history (#10302 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:10302>).
.IP \(bu 2
Bindings can now mix special input functions and shell commands, so \fBbind ctrl\-g expand\-abbr \(dqcommandline \-i \en\(dq\fP works as expected (#8186 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:8186>).
.IP \(bu 2
Special input functions run from bindings via \fBcommandline \-f\fP are now applied immediately, instead of after the currently executing binding (#3031 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:3031>, #10126 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:10126>).
For example, \fBcommandline \-i foo; commandline | grep foo\fP succeeds now.
.IP \(bu 2
Undo history is no longer truncated after every command, but kept for the lifetime of the shell process.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBctrl\fP\-\fBr\fP history search now uses glob syntax (#10131 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:10131>).
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBctrl\fP\-\fBr\fP history search now operates only on the line or command substitution at cursor, making it easier to combine commands from history (#9751 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:9751>).
.IP \(bu 2

.IP \(bu 2
\fBcommandline \-\-tokenize\fP (short option \fB\-o\fP) has been deprecated in favor of \fBcommandline \-\-tokens\-expanded\fP (short option \fB\-x\fP) which expands variables and other shell syntax, removing the need to use eval \%<> in completion scripts (#10212 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:10212>).
.IP \(bu 2
Two new feature flags:
.INDENT 2.0

\fBremove\-percent\-self\fP (see \fBstatus features\fP) disables PID expansion of \fB%self\fP, which has been supplanted by \fB$fish_pid\fP (#10262 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:10262>).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtest\-require\-arg\fP disables \fBtest\fP\(aqs one\-argument mode. That means \fBtest \-n\fP without an additional argument will return false, \fBtest \-z\fP will keep returning true. Any other option without an argument, anything that is not an option and no argument will be an error. This also goes for \fB[\fP, test\(aqs alternate name.
This is a frequent source of confusion and so we are breaking with POSIX explicitly in this regard.
In addition to the feature flag, there is a debug category \(dqdeprecated\-test\(dq. Running fish with \fBfish \-d deprecated\-test\fP will show warnings whenever a \fBtest\fP invocation that would change is used. (#10365 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:10365>).

fish has been ported to Rust. This means a significant change in dependencies, which are listed in the README. In short, Rust 1.70 or greater is required, and a C++ compiler is no longer needed (although a C compiler is still required, for some C glue code and the tests).
.sp
CMake remains the recommended build system, because of cargo\(aqs limited support for installing support files. Version 3.5 remains the minimum supported version. The Xcode generator for CMake is not supported any longer (#9924 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:9924>). CMake builds default to optimized release builds (#10799 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:10799>).
.sp
fish no longer depends on the ncurses library, but still uses a terminfo database. When packaging fish, please add a dependency on the package containing your terminfo database instead of curses.
.sp
The \fBtest\fP target was removed as it can no longer be defined in new CMake versions. Use \fBmake fish_run_tests\fP\&. Any existing test target will not print output if it fails (#11116 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:11116>).

The Web\-based configuration has been rewritten to use Alpine.js (#9554 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:9554>).

.SS fish 3.7.0 (released January 1, 2024)
.sp
This release of fish includes a number of improvements over fish 3.6.4, detailed below. Although work continues on the porting of fish internals to the Rust programming language, that work is not included in this release. fish 3.7.0 and any future releases in the 3.7 series remain C++ programs.
.SS Notable improvements and fixes
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Improvements to the history pager, including:
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
The history pager will now also attempt subsequence matches (#9476 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:9476>), so you can find a command line like \fBgit log 3.6.1..Integration_3.7.0\fP by searching for \fBgitInt\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
Opening the history pager will now fill the search field with a search string if you\(aqre already in a search (#10005 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:10005>). This makes it nicer to search something with \fBup\fP and then later decide to switch to the full pager.
.IP \(bu 2
Closing the history pager with enter will now copy the search text to the commandline if there was no match, so you can continue editing the command you tried to find right away (#9934 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:9934>).
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
Performance improvements for command completions and globbing, where supported by the operating system, especially on slow filesystems such as NFS (#9891 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:9891>, #9931 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:9931>, #10032 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:10032>, #10052 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:10052>).
.IP \(bu 2
fish can now be configured to wait a specified amount of time for a multi\-key sequence to be completed,  instead of waiting indefinitely. For example, this makes binding \fBkj\fP to switching modes in vi mode possible.
The timeout can be set via the new \fBfish_sequence_key_delay_ms\fP \%<#\:envvar-fish_sequence_key_delay_ms> variable (#7401 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:7401>), and may be set by default in future versions.

\fBcommand time\fP in a pipeline is allowed again, as is \fBcommand and\fP and \fBcommand or\fP (#9985 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:9985>).

.SS fish 3.6.2 (released December 4, 2023)
.sp
This release of fish contains a security fix for CVE\-2023\-49284, a minor security problem identified
in fish 3.6.1 and previous versions (thought to affect all released versions of fish).
.sp
fish uses certain Unicode non\-characters internally for marking wildcards and expansions. It
incorrectly allowed these markers to be read on command substitution output, rather than
transforming them into a safe internal representation.
.sp
For example, \fBecho \eUFDD2HOME\fP has the same output as \fBecho $HOME\fP\&.
.sp
While this may cause unexpected behavior with direct input, this may become a minor security problem
if the output is being fed from an external program into a command substitution where this output
may not be expected.

.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBstderr\-nocaret\fP feature flag, introduced in fish 3.0 and enabled by default in fish 3.1, has been made read\-only.
That means it is no longer possible to disable it, and code supporting the \fB^\fP redirection has been removed (#8857 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:8857>, #8865 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:8865>).
.sp
To recap: fish used to support \fB^\fP to redirect stderr, so you could use commands like:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
test \(dq$foo\(dq \-gt 8 ^/dev/null
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
to ignore error messages. This made the \fB^\fP symbol require escaping and quoting, and was a bit of a weird shortcut considering \fB2>\fP already worked, which is only one character longer.
.sp
So the above can simply become:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
test \(dq$foo\(dq \-gt 8 2>/dev/null
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
The following feature flags have been enabled by default:
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBregex\-easyesc\fP, which makes \fBstring replace \-r\fP not do a superfluous round of unescaping in the replacement expression.
That means e.g. to escape any \(dqa\(dq or \(dqb\(dq in an argument you can use \fBstring replace \-ra \(aq([ab])\(aq \(aq\e\e\e\e$1\(aq foobar\fP instead of needing 8 backslashes.
.sp
This only affects the \fIreplacement\fP expression, not the \fImatch\fP expression (the \fB\(aq([ab])\(aq\fP part in the example).
A survey of plugins on GitHub did not turn up any affected code, so we do not expect this to affect many users.
.sp
This flag was introduced in fish 3.1.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBampersand\-nobg\-in\-token\fP, which means that \fB&\fP will not create a background job if it occurs in the middle of a word. For example, \fBecho foo&bar\fP will print \(dqfoo&bar\(dq instead of running \fBecho foo\fP in the background and then starting \fBbar\fP as a second job.
.sp
Reformatting with \fBfish_indent\fP would already introduce spaces, turning \fBecho foo&bar\fP into \fBecho foo & bar\fP\&.
.sp
This flag was introduced in fish 3.4.
.UNINDENT
.sp
To turn off these flags, add \fBno\-regex\-easyesc\fP or \fBno\-ampersand\-nobg\-in\-token\fP to \fBfish_features\fP and restart fish:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set \-Ua fish_features no\-regex\-easyesc
.EE
.UNINDENT

Like \fBstderr\-nocaret\fP, they will eventually be made read\-only.

Most \fBstring\fP subcommands no longer append a newline to their input if the input didn\(aqt have one (#8473 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:8473>, #3847 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:3847>)
.IP \(bu 2
Fish\(aqs escape sequence removal (like for \fBstring length \-\-visible\fP or to figure out how wide the prompt is) no longer has special support for non\-standard color sequences like from Data General terminals, e.g. the Data General Dasher D220 from 1984. This removes a bunch of work in the common case, allowing \fBstring length \-\-visible\fP to be much faster with unknown escape sequences. We don\(aqt expect anyone to have ever used fish with such a terminal (#8769 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:8769>).
.IP \(bu 2
Code to upgrade universal variables from fish before 3.0 has been removed. Users who upgrade directly from fish versions 2.7.1 or before will have to set their universal variables & abbreviations again. (#8781 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:8781>)
.IP \(bu 2
The meaning of an empty color variable has changed (#8793 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:8793>). Previously, when a variable was set but empty, it would be interpreted as the \(dqnormal\(dq color. Now, empty color variables cause the same effect as unset variables \- the general highlighting variable for that type is used instead. For example:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set \-g fish_color_command blue
set \-g fish_color_keyword
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
would previously make keywords \(dqnormal\(dq (usually white in a dark terminal). Now it\(aqll make them blue. To achieve the previous behavior, use the normal color explicitly: \fBset \-g fish_color_keyword normal\fP\&.
.sp
This makes it easier to make self\-contained color schemes that don\(aqt accidentally use color that was set before.
\fBfish_config\fP has been adjusted to set known color variables that a theme doesn\(aqt explicitly set to empty.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBeval\fP is now a reserved keyword, so it can\(aqt be used as a function name. This follows \fBset\fP and \fBread\fP, and is necessary because it can\(aqt be cleanly shadowed by a function \- at the very least \fBeval set \-l argv foo\fP breaks. Fish will ignore autoload files for it, so left over \fBeval.fish\fP from previous fish versions won\(aqt be loaded.
.IP \(bu 2
The git prompt in informative mode now defaults to skipping counting untracked files, as this was extremely slow. To turn it on, set \fB__fish_git_prompt_showuntrackedfiles\fP or set the git config value \(dqbash.showuntrackedfiles\(dq to \fBtrue\fP explicitly (which can be done for individual repositories). The \(dqinformative+vcs\(dq sample prompt already skipped display of untracked files, but didn\(aqt do so in a way that skipped the computation, so it should be quite a bit faster in many cases (#8980 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:8980>).
.IP \(bu 2
The \fB__terlar_git_prompt\fP function, used by the \(dqTerlar\(dq sample prompt, has been rebuilt as a configuration of the normal \fBfish_git_prompt\fP to ease maintenance, improve performance and add features (like reading per\-repo git configuration). Some slight changes remain; users who absolutely must have the same behavior are encouraged to copy the old function (#9011 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:9011>, #7918 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:7918>, #8979 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:8979>).

Complementing the \fBprompt\fP command in 3.3.0, \fBfish_config\fP gained a \fBtheme\fP subcommand to show and pick from the sample themes (meaning color schemes) directly in the terminal, instead of having to open a Web browser. For example \fBfish_config theme choose Nord\fP loads the Nord theme in the current session (#8132 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:8132>). The current theme can be saved with \fBfish_config theme dump\fP, and custom themes can be added by saving them in \fB~/.config/fish/themes/\fP\&.

\fBset\fP and \fBread\fP learned a new option, \fB\-\-function\fP, to set a variable in the function\(aqs top scope.

Autosuggestions can now be turned off by setting \fB$fish_autosuggestion_enabled\fP to 0, and (almost) all highlighting can be turned off by choosing the new \(dqNone\(dq theme.

The \fBfish_git_prompt\fP function, which is included in the default prompts, now overrides \fBgit\fP to avoid running  commands set by per\-repository configuration. This avoids a potential security issue in some circumstances, and has been assigned CVE\-2022\-20001 (#8589 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:8589>).

A new feature flag, \fBampersand\-nobg\-in\-token\fP makes \fB&\fP only act as background operator if followed by a separator. In combination with \fBqmark\-noglob\fP, this allows entering most URLs at the command line without quoting or escaping (#7991 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:7991>). For example:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5

\fBset \-\-query\fP now returns an exit status of 255 if given no variable names. This means \fBif set \-q $foo\fP will not enter the if\-block if \fB$foo\fP is empty or unset. To restore the previous behavior, use \fBif not set \-q foo; or set \-q $foo\fP \- but this is unlikely to be desirable (#8214 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:8214>).

.SS Notable improvements and fixes
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_config\fP gained a \fBprompt\fP subcommand to show and pick from the sample prompts directly in the terminal, instead of having to open a webbrowser. For example \fBfish_config prompt choose default\fP loads the default prompt in the current session (#7958 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:7958>).

.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The \fB$fish_history\fP value \(dqdefault\(dq is no longer special. It used to be treated the same as \(dqfish\(dq (#7650 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:7650>).
.IP \(bu 2
Redirection to standard error with the \fB^\fP character has been disabled by default. It can be turned back on using the \fBstderr\-nocaret\fP feature flag, but will eventually be disabled completely (#7105 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:7105>).
.IP \(bu 2
Specifying an initial tab to \fBfish_config\fP now only works with \fBfish_config browse\fP (eg \fBfish_config browse variables\fP), otherwise it would interfere with the new \fBprompt\fP subcommand (see below) (#7958 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:7958>).
.UNINDENT
.SS Scripting improvements
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmath\fP gained new functions \fBlog2\fP (like the documentation claimed), \fBmax\fP and \fBmin\fP (#7856 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:7856>). \fBmath\fP functions can be used without the parentheses (eg \fBmath sin 2 + 6\fP), and functions have the lowest precedence in the order of operations (#7877 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:7877>).
.IP \(bu 2
Shebang (\fB#!\fP) lines are no longer required within shell scripts, improving support for scripts with concatenated binary contents. If a file fails to execute and passes a (rudimentary) binary safety check, fish will re\-invoke it using \fB/bin/sh\fP (#7802 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:7802>).
.IP \(bu 2
Exit codes are better aligned with bash. A failed execution now reports \fB$status\fP of 127 if the file is not found, and 126 if it is not executable.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBecho\fP no longer writes its output one byte at a time, improving performance and allowing use with Linux\(aqs special API files (\fB/proc\fP, \fB/sys\fP and such) (#7836 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:7836>).
.IP \(bu 2
fish should now better handle \fBcd\fP on filesystems with broken \fBstat(3)\fP responses (#7577 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:7577>).
.IP \(bu 2
Builtins now properly report a \fB$status\fP of 1 upon unsuccessful writes (#7857 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:7857>).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstring match\fP with unmatched capture groups and without the \fB\-\-all\fP flag now sets an empty variable instead of a variable containing the empty string. It also correctly imports the first match if multiple arguments are provided, matching the documentation. (#7938 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:7938>).
.IP \(bu 2
fish produces more specific errors when a command in a command substitution wasn\(aqt found or is not allowed. This now prints something like \(dqUnknown command\(dq instead of \(dqUnknown error while evaluating command substitution\(dq.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_indent\fP allows inline variable assignments (\fBFOO=BAR command\fP) to use line continuation, instead of joining them into one line (#7955 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:7955>).
.IP \(bu 2
fish gained a \fB\-\-no\-config\fP option to disable configuration files. This applies to user\-specific and the systemwide \fBconfig.fish\fP (typically in \fB/etc/fish/config.fish\fP), and configuration snippets (typically in \fBconf.d\fP directories). It also disables universal variables, history, and loading of functions from system or user configuration directories (#7921 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:7921>, #1256 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:1256>).
.IP \(bu 2
When universal variables are unavailable for some reason, setting a universal variable now sets a global variable instead (#7921 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:7921>).
.IP \(bu 2
\fB$last_pid\fP now contains the process ID of the last process in the pipeline, allowing it to be used in scripts (#5036 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:5036>, #5832 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:5832>, #7721 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:7721>). Previously, this value contained the process group ID, but in scripts this was the same as the running fish\(aqs process ID.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBprocess\-exit\fP event handlers now receive the same value as \fB$status\fP in all cases, instead of receiving \-1 when the exit was due to a signal.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBprocess\-exit\fP event handlers for PID 0 also received \fBJOB_EXIT\fP events; this has been fixed.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBjob\-exit\fP event handlers may now be created with any of the PIDs from the job. The handler is passed the last PID in the job as its second argument, instead of the process group.
.IP \(bu 2
Trying to set an empty variable name with \fBset\fP no longer works (these variables could not be used in expansions anyway).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_add_path\fP handles an undefined \fBPATH\fP environment variable correctly (#8082 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:8082>).

.IP \(bu 2
\fB$SHLVL\fP is no longer incremented in non\-interactive shells. This means it won\(aqt be set to values larger than 1 just because your environment happens to run some scripts in $SHELL in its startup path (#7864 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:7864>).
.IP \(bu 2
fish no longer rings the bell when flashing the command line. The flashing should already be enough notification and the bell can be annoying (#7875 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:7875>).

\fBcomplete\fP takes the first argument as the name of the command if the \fB\-\-command\fP/\fB\-c\fP option is not used,

\fBfish_greeting\fP is now a function that reads a variable of the same name, and defaults to setting it globally.
This removes a universal variable by default and helps with updating the greeting.
However, to disable the greeting it is now necessary to explicitly specify universal scope (\fBset \-U fish_greeting\fP) or to disable it in config.fish (#7265 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:7265>).

The command\-not\-found handling has been simplified.
When it can\(aqt find a command, fish now just executes a function called \fBfish_command_not_found\fP

\fBstring replace\fP has an additional round of escaping in the

(eg \fBstring replace \-ra \(aq([ab])\(aq \(aq\e\e\e\e\e\e\e$1\(aq a\fP). The new feature

browsers from other programs using AppleScript. This affects the fish
Web configuration (\fBfish_config\fP); users on these platforms will

.SS fish 2.5b1 (released January 14, 2017)
.SS Platform Changes

Starting with version 2.5, fish requires a more up\-to\-date version of
C++, specifically C++11 (from 2011). This affects some older platforms:
.SS Linux
.sp
For users building from source, GCC’s g++ 4.8 or later, or LLVM’s clang
3.3 or later, are known to work. Older platforms may require a newer
compiler installed.

packages are no longer published by the fish\-shell developers for the

Installing newer version of fish on these systems will require building
from source.
.SS OS X SnowLeopard

Starting with version 2.5, fish requires a C++11 standard library on OS
X 10.6 (“SnowLeopard”). If this library is not installed, you will see
this error: \fBdyld: Library not loaded: /usr/lib/libc++.1.dylib\fP
.sp
MacPorts is the easiest way to obtain this library. After installing the

A new \fBstring\fP builtin to handle… strings! This builtin will
measure, split, search and replace text strings, including using
regular expressions. It can also be used to turn lists into plain
strings using \fBjoin\fP\&. \fBstring\fP can be used in place of \fBsed\fP,
\fBgrep\fP, \fBtr\fP, \fBcut\fP, and \fBawk\fP in many situations. (#2296 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:2296>)

Allow using escape as the Meta modifier key, by waiting after seeing
an escape character wait up to 300ms for an additional character.
This is consistent with readline (e.g.\ bash) and can be configured

as the Meta modifier. (#1356 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:1356>)

.SS fish 2.1.2 (released Feb 24, 2015)
.sp
fish 2.1.2 contains a workaround for a filesystem bug in Mac OS X
Yosemite. #1859 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:1859>
.sp
Specifically, after installing fish 2.1.1 and then rebooting, “Verify
Disk” in Disk Utility will report “Invalid number of hard links.” We
don’t have any reports of data loss or other adverse consequences. fish
2.1.2 avoids triggering the bug, but does not repair an already affected
filesystem. To repair the filesystem, you can boot into Recovery Mode
and use Repair Disk from Disk Utility. Linux and versions of OS X prior
to Yosemite are believed to be unaffected.

\fBTab completions will fuzzy\-match files.\fP #568 \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:fish-shell/\:fish-shell/\:issues/\:568>
.sp
When tab\-completing a file, fish will first attempt prefix matches
(\fBfoo\fP matches \fBfoobar\fP), then substring matches (\fBooba\fP
matches \fBfoobar\fP), and lastly subsequence matches (\fBfbr\fP matches
\fBfoobar\fP). For example, in a directory with files foo1.txt,
foo2.txt, foo3.txt…, you can type only the numeric part and hit tab
to fill in the rest.
.sp
This feature is implemented for files and executables. It is not yet
implemented for options (like \fB\-\-foobar\fP), and not yet implemented
across path components (like \fB/u/l/b\fP to match \fB/usr/local/bin\fP).

Previously, a single \fB%\fP would pid\-expand to either all
backgrounded jobs, or all jobs owned by your user. Now it expands to
the last job backgrounded. If no job is in the background, it will
fail to expand. In particular, \fBfg %\fP can be used to put the most
recent background job in the foreground.

\fBAutosuggestions\fP\&. Think URL fields in browsers. When you type a

completions, and some custom code for cd; there’s a lot of potential

\fBterm256 support\fP where available, specifically modern xterms and

fish is now entirely in C++. I have no particular love for C++, but
it provides a ready memory\-model to replace halloc. We’ve made an

no going crazy with templates or smart pointers), but we do use the
STL and a little tr1.

All the crufty C data structures are entirely gone. array_list_t,
priority_queue_t, hash_table_t, string_buffer_t have been removed and

instead of wchar_t *

.IP \(bu 2
The files in share/functions and share/completions now get
‘internalized’ into C strings that get compiled in with fish. This
substantially reduces the number of files touched at startup. A
consequence is that you cannot change these functions without
recompiling, but often other functions depend on these “standard”
functions, so changing them is perhaps not a good idea anyways.

The large number of forks relative to bash are due to fish’s insanely
expensive default prompt, which is unchanged in my version. If we switch
to a prompt comparable to bash’s (lame) default, the forks drop to 16
with trunk, 4 after our changes.
.sp
The large reduction in lstat() numbers is due to fish no longer needing
to call ttyname() on OS X.

We’ve got some work to do to be as lean as bash, but we’re on the right
track.
.SS Terminal Compatibility
.sp
fish writes various control sequences to the terminal.
Some must be implemented to enable basic functionality,
while others enable optional features and may be ignored by the terminal.
.sp
The terminal must be able to parse Control Sequence Introducer (CSI) commands, Operating System Commands (OSC) and optionally Device Control Strings (DCS).
These are defined by ECMA\-48.
If a valid CSI, OSC or DCS sequence does not represent a command implemented by the terminal, the terminal must ignore it.
.sp
Control sequences are denoted in a fish\-like syntax.
Special characters other than \fB\e\fP are not escaped.
Spaces are only added for readability and are not part of the sequence.

.SS DCS commands and GNU screen
.sp
Fully\-correct DCS parsing is optional because fish switches to the alternate screen before printing any DCS commands.
However, since GNU screen neither allows turning on the alternate screen buffer by default,
nor treats DCS commands in a compatible way,
fish\(aqs initial prompt may be garbled by a DCS payload like \fB+q696e646e\fP\&.
For the time being, fish works around this by checking for presence of the \fBSTY\fP environment variable.
If that doesn\(aqt work for some reason, you can add this to your \fB~/.screenrc\fP:

In short:
.INDENT 0.0

Be conservative in what you need (keep to the agreed minimum supported Rust version, limit new dependencies)
.IP \(bu 2

.UNINDENT
.SS Contributing completions
.sp
Completion scripts are the most common contribution to fish, and they are very welcome.
.sp
In general, we\(aqll take all well\-written completion scripts for a command that is publicly available.
This means no private tools or personal scripts, and we do reserve the right to reject for other reasons.
.sp
Before you try to contribute them to fish, consider if the authors of the tool you are completing want to maintain the script instead.
Often that makes more sense, specifically because they can add new options to the script immediately once they add them,
and don\(aqt have to maintain one completion script for multiple versions. If the authors no longer wish to maintain the script,
they can of course always contact the fish maintainers to hand it over, preferably by opening a PR.
This isn\(aqt a requirement \- if the authors don\(aqt want to maintain it, or you simply don\(aqt want to contact them,
you can contribute your script to fish.
.sp
Completion scripts should
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Use as few dependencies as possible \- try to use fish\(aqs builtins like \fBstring\fP instead of \fBgrep\fP and \fBawk\fP,
use \fBpython\fP to read json instead of \fBjq\fP (because it\(aqs already a soft dependency for fish\(aqs tools)
.IP 2. 3
If it uses a common unix tool, use POSIX\-compatible invocations \- ideally it would work on GNU/Linux, macOS, the BSDs and other systems
.IP 3. 3
Option and argument descriptions should be kept short.
The shorter the description, the more likely it is that fish can use more columns.
.IP 4. 3
Function names should start with \fB__fish\fP, and functions should be kept in the completion file unless they\(aqre used elsewhere.
.IP 5. 3
Run \fBfish_indent\fP on your script.
.IP 6. 3
Try not to use minor convenience features right after they are available in fish \- we do try to keep completion scripts backportable.
If something has a real impact on the correctness or performance, feel free to use it,
but if it is just a shortcut, please leave it.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Put your completion script into share/completions/name\-of\-command.fish. If you have multiple commands, you need multiple files.

If you want to add tests, you probably want to add a littlecheck test. See below for details.

.SS Testing
.sp
The source code for fish includes a large collection of tests. If you
are making any changes to fish, running these tests is a good way to make
sure the behaviour remains consistent and regressions are not
introduced. Even if you don’t run the tests on your machine, they will
still be run via Github Actions.
.sp
You are strongly encouraged to add tests when changing the functionality
of fish, especially if you are fixing a bug to help ensure there are no
regressions in the future (i.e., we don’t reintroduce the bug).
.sp
Unit tests live next to the implementation in Rust source files, in inline submodules (\fBmod tests {}\fP).
.sp
System tests live in \fBtests/\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtests/checks\fP are run by littlecheck \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:ridiculousfish/\:littlecheck>
and test noninteractive (script) behavior,
except for \fBtests/checks/tmux\-*\fP which test interactive scenarios.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtests/pexpects\fP tests interactive scenarios using pexpect \%<https://\:pexpect\:.readthedocs\:.io/\:en/\:stable/>
.UNINDENT
.sp
When in doubt, the bulk of the tests should be added as a littlecheck test in tests/checks, as they are the easiest to modify and run, and much faster and more dependable than pexpect tests.
The syntax is fairly self\-explanatory.
It\(aqs a fish script with the expected output in \fB# CHECK:\fP or \fB# CHECKERR:\fP (for stderr) comments.
If your littlecheck test has a specific dependency, use \fB# REQUIRE: ...\fP with a POSIX sh script.
.sp
The pexpect tests are written in Python and can simulate input and output to/from a terminal, so they are needed for anything that needs actual interactivity.
The runner is in tests/pexpect_helper.py, in case you need to modify something there.
.sp
These tests can be run via the tests/test_driver.py Python script, which will set up the environment.
It sets up a temporary $HOME and also uses it as the current directory, so you do not need to create a temporary directory in them.
.sp
If you need a command to do something weird to test something, maybe add it to the \fBfish_test_helper\fP binary (in \fBtests/fish_test_helper.c\fP).
.SS Local testing

.SS Contributing Translations
.sp
Fish uses GNU gettext to translate messages from English to other languages.
We use custom tools for extracting messages from source files and to localize at runtime.
This means that we do not have a runtime dependency on the gettext library.
It also means that some features are not supported, such as message context and plurals.
We also expect all files to be UTF\-8\-encoded.
In practice, this should not matter much for contributing translations.
.sp
Translation sources are
stored in the \fBpo\fP directory, named \fBll_CC.po\fP, where \fBll\fP is the
two (or possibly three) letter ISO 639\-1 language code of the target language
(e.g. \fBpt\fP for Portuguese). \fBCC\fP is an ISO 3166 country/territory code,
(e.g. \fBBR\fP for Brazil).
An example for a valid name is \fBpt_BR.po\fP, indicating Brazilian Portuguese.
These are the files you will interact with when adding translations.
.SS Adding translations for a new language
.sp
Creating new translations requires the Gettext tools.
More specifically, you will need \fBmsguniq\fP and \fBmsgmerge\fP for creating translations for a new
language.
To create a new translation, run:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
build_tools/update_translations.fish po/ll_CC.po
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will create a new PO file containing all messages available for translation.
If the file already exists, it will be updated.
.sp
After modifying a PO file, you can recompile fish, and it will integrate the modifications you made.
This requires that the \fBmsgfmt\fP utility is installed (comes as part of \fBgettext\fP).
It is important that the \fBlocalize\-messages\fP cargo feature is enabled, which it is by default.
You can explicitly enable it using:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
cargo build \-\-features=localize\-messages
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Use environment variables to tell fish which language to use, e.g.:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
LANG=pt_BR.utf8 fish
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
or within the running fish shell:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set LANG pt_BR.utf8
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For more options regarding how to choose languages, see
the corresponding gettext documentation \%<https://\:www\:.gnu\:.org/\:software/\:gettext/\:manual/\:html_node/\:Locale-Environment-Variables\:.html>\&.
One neat thing you can do is set a list of languages to check for translations in the order defined
using the \fBLANGUAGE\fP variable, e.g.:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
set LANGUAGE pt_BR de_DE
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
to try to translate messages to Portuguese, if that fails try German, and if that fails too you will
see the English version defined in the source code.
.SS Modifying existing translations
.sp
If you want to work on translations for a language which already has a corresponding \fBpo\fP file, it
is sufficient to edit this file. No other changes are necessary.
.sp
After recompiling fish, you should be able to see your translations in action. See the previous
section for details.
.SS Editing PO files
.sp
Many tools are available for editing translation files, including
command\-line and graphical user interface programs. For simple use, you can use your text editor.
.sp
Open up the PO file, for example \fBpo/sv.po\fP, and you\(aqll see something like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
msgid \(dq%s: No suitable job\en\(dq
msgstr \(dq\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBmsgid\fP here is the \(dqname\(dq of the string to translate, typically the English string to translate.
The second line (\fBmsgstr\fP) is where your translation goes.
.sp
For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
msgid \(dq%s: No suitable job\en\(dq
msgstr \(dq%s: Inget passande jobb\en\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Any \fB%s\fP or \fB%d\fP are placeholders that fish will use for formatting at runtime. It is important that they match \- the translated string should have the same placeholders in the same order.
.sp
Also any escaped characters, like that \fB\en\fP newline at the end, should be kept so the translation has the same behavior.
.sp
Our tests run \fBmsgfmt \-\-check\-format /path/to/file\fP, so they would catch mismatched placeholders \- otherwise fish would crash at runtime when the string is about to be used.
.sp
Be cautious about blindly updating an existing translation file.
\fBmsgid\fP strings should never be updated manually, only by running the appropriate script.
.SS Modifications to strings in source files
.sp
If a string changes in the sources, the old translations will no longer work.
They will be preserved in the PO files, but commented\-out (starting with \fB#~\fP).
If you add/remove/change a translatable strings in a source file,
run \fBbuild_tools/update_translations.fish\fP to propagate this to all translation files (\fBpo/*.po\fP).
This is only relevant for developers modifying the source files of fish or fish scripts.
.SS Setting Code Up For Translations
.sp
All non\-debug messages output for user consumption should be marked for
translation. In Rust, this requires the use of the \fBwgettext!\fP or \fBwgettext_fmt!\fP
macros:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
streams.out.append(wgettext_fmt!(\(dq%s: There are no jobs\en\(dq, argv[0]));
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
All messages in fish script must be enclosed in single or double quote
characters for our message extraction script to find them.
They must also be translated via a command substitution. This means
that the following are \fBnot\fP valid:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
echo (_ hello)
_ \(dqgoodbye\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Above should be written like this instead:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
echo (_ \(dqhello\(dq)
echo (_ \(dqgoodbye\(dq)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can use either single or double quotes to enclose the
message to be translated. You can also optionally include spaces after
the opening parentheses or before the closing parentheses.
.SS Updating Dependencies
.sp
To update dependencies, run \fBbuild_tools/update\-dependencies.sh\fP\&.
This currently requires updatecli \%<https://\:github\:.com/\:updatecli/\:updatecli> and a few other tools.
.SS Versioning
.sp
The fish version is constructed by the \fIbuild_tools/git_version_gen.sh\fP
script. For developers the version is the branch name plus the output of
\fBgit describe \-\-always \-\-dirty\fP\&. Normally the main part of the version
will be the closest annotated tag. Which itself is usually the most
recent release number (e.g., \fB2.6.0\fP).

\fBPreamble\fP
.sp
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software \- to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation\(aqs software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to your programs, too.
.sp
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
.sp
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
.sp
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
.sp
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.
.sp
Also, for each author\(aqs protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors\(aq reputations.
.sp
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone\(aqs free use or not licensed at all.
.sp
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
.sp
\fBTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The \(dqProgram\(dq, below, refers to any such program or work, and a \(dqwork based on the Program\(dq means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \(dqmodification\(dq.) Each licensee is addressed as \(dqyou\(dq.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program\(aqs source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 2. 3
You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
.IP \(bu 2
You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
.IP \(bu 2
If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
.UNINDENT
.sp
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
.sp
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.
.sp
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 3. 3
You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine\-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
.IP \(bu 2
Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine\-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
.IP \(bu 2
Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
.UNINDENT
.sp
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
.sp
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 4. 3
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
.IP 5. 3
You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
.IP 6. 3
Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients\(aq exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
.IP 7. 3
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty\-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

.INDENT 3.5
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
.sp
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

.IP 8. 3
If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
.IP 9. 3
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
.UNINDENT

.INDENT 3.5
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \(dqany later version\(dq, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

.B [This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBPreamble\fP
.sp
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software\-\-to make sure the software is free for all its users.
.sp
This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
your libraries, too.
.sp
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
.sp
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.
.sp
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
.sp
Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
.sp
Also, for each distributor\(aqs protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors\(aq reputations.
.sp
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone\(aqs
free use or not licensed at all.
.sp
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
one; be sure to read it in full, and don\(aqt assume that anything in it is
the same as in the ordinary license.
.sp
The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
treats it as such.
.sp
Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.
.sp
However, unrestricted linking of non\-free programs would deprive the
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
permit developers of non\-free programs to use free libraries, while
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
will lead to faster development of free libraries.
.sp
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
\(dqwork based on the library\(dq and a \(dqwork that uses the library\(dq.  The
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
works together with the library.
.sp
Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary

\fBTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\fP
.sp
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
General Public License (also called \(dqthis License\(dq).  Each licensee is
addressed as \(dqyou\(dq.
.sp
A \(dqlibrary\(dq means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
.sp
The \(dqLibrary\(dq, below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A \(dqwork based on the
Library\(dq means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term \(dqmodification\(dq.)
.sp
\(dqSource code\(dq for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.
.sp
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
.sp
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library\(aqs
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.
.sp
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.
.sp
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP a. 3
The modified work must itself be a software library.
.UNINDENT
.sp
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
.sp
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
.sp
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
in the event an application does not supply such function or
table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
its purpose remains meaningful.
.sp
(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
a purpose that is entirely well\-defined independent of the
application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
application\-supplied function or table used by this function must
be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
root function must still compute square roots.)
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.
.sp
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.
.sp
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.
.sp
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.
.sp
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
.sp
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.
.sp
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine\-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.
.sp
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
.sp
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a \(dqwork that uses the Library\(dq.  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
.sp
However, linking a \(dqwork that uses the Library\(dq with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a \(dqwork that uses the
library\(dq.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
.sp
When a \(dqwork that uses the Library\(dq uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
.sp
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)
.sp
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
.sp
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
link a \(dqwork that uses the Library\(dq with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer\(aqs own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.
.sp
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
machine\-readable source code for the Library including whatever
changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
with the Library, with the complete machine\-readable \(dqwork that
uses the Library\(dq, as object code and/or source code, so that the
user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
to use the modified definitions.)
.sp
b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
least three years, to give the same user the materials
specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
than the cost of performing this distribution.
.sp
c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
specified materials from the same place.
.sp
d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For an executable, the required form of the \(dqwork that uses the
Library\(dq must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.
.sp
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.
.sp
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side\-by\-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
Sections above.
.sp
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
.sp
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.
.sp
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients\(aq exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.
.sp
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty\-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
.sp
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
.sp
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
.sp
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.
.sp
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.
.sp
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
.sp
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
\(dqany later version\(dq, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.
.sp
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.
.sp
\fBNO WARRANTY\fP
.sp
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \(dqAS IS\(dq WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
.sp
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.
